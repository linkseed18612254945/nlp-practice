 = Tropical Storm <unk> ( 2008 ) = 
 
 Tropical Storm <unk> was the tenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season . <unk> developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August 31 . The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located 170 mi ( 270 km ) to the south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September 2 . The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> around noon the same day . Over the next several days , <unk> moved in a general west @-@ northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September 3 . Strong wind shear , some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken . On September 6 , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused <unk> to weaken into a tropical depression . <unk> deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm . The low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi ( 835 km ) east of <unk> on September 10 . However , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of St. Croix .

 Tropical Storm <unk> formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August 2008 . It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed , and on September 2 the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde islands . As the depression became more organized , an eye @-@ like feature developed in the upper levels of the system . The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> six hours after forming . <unk> was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly . 
 <unk> continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical . However , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity . Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification . The storm was also heading into an area where shear was <unk> to significantly increase due to an upper @-@ level trough diving southward . Despite convection being partially removed from the center of <unk> , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized . The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger . 
 <unk> reached its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 a.m. ( <unk> ) as it continued to become more organized . However , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken . <unk> towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system . During the afternoon hours , the structure of <unk> began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll . By the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center . 
 Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear , a large , deep burst of convection formed in the northern <unk> of <unk> . The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity . The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as <unk> continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 @-@ day forecast was predicted . However , the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and <unk> weakened again . By the afternoon , the center of <unk> was only a <unk> of clouds , devoid of convection . During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5 , convection associated with <unk> began to <unk> somewhat , mostly to the north of the circulation , due to the strong <unk> wind shear . By mid @-@ morning , <unk> re @-@ intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection . However , the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on <unk> by late morning . The convection around the system became <unk> from the center and <unk> weakened slightly . 
 The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong <unk> shear . <unk> became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid @-@ afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , barely holding on to tropical storm status . <unk> regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm . Due to the lack of convection , <unk> was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at <unk> ( <unk> ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . Since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm <unk> over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression . The next morning , <unk> was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm . No redevelopment was expected with <unk> as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated . 
 However , the remnant low associated with <unk> began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 . <unk> around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . <unk> around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of <unk> deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of <unk> redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of <unk> headed towards the Bahamas . However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . 
 
 = = Impact = = 
 
 As <unk> passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands on September 2 , outer rain bands produced minor rainfall , totaling around 0 @.@ 55 inches ( 14 mm ) . There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor . 
 Several days after the low dissipated , the remnant moisture from <unk> brought showers and thunderstorms to St. Croix where up to 1 in ( 25 @.@ 4 mm ) of rain fell . The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding . No known damage was caused by the flood .

 = Angel of Death ( Slayer song ) = 
 
 "" Angel of Death "" is the opening track on the American thrash metal band Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The lyrics and music were written by Slayer guitarist , Jeff Hanneman and are based on Nazi physician <unk> <unk> , who conducted human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . "" Angel of Death "" led to the band facing accusations of Nazi <unk> and racism throughout their career . 
 Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood , "" Angel of Death "" is featured on all of Slayer 's live albums and DVDs and has appeared in several movies . The song was well received by critics ; Steve Huey of AllMusic described it as a "" classic "" .

 Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote "" Angel of Death "" after reading books about Nazi physician <unk> <unk> while on tour with the band : "" I remember stopping <unk> where I bought two books on <unk> . I thought , ' This has gotta be some sick shit . ' So when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head — that 's where the lyrics to ' Angel of Death ' came from . "" 
 The lyrics detail <unk> 's surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . <unk> 's <unk> were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations . Among the tests he performed that are mentioned in "" Angel of Death "" are experimental <unk> performed without anesthesia , transfusion of blood between twins , isolation endurance , <unk> , <unk> with lethal <unk> , sex change operations , the removal of organs and limbs , and <unk> . 
 "" <unk> together , joining heads . Just a matter of time ' <unk> you rip <unk> apart "" , a line from the penultimate verse , is a reference to the allegation <unk> <unk> together twins , one of them deformed ; "" the <unk> was <unk> to the other child , back to back , their wrists back to back too . "" This claim was first made by Auschwitz survivor <unk> Alexander at the 1961 trial of SS @-@ <unk> Adolf <unk> the "" architect of the Holocaust "" , where it was asserted that <unk> "" <unk> the veins together "" and turned "" them into <unk> twins . "" This allegation became more widely known when <unk> Alexander was featured in the 1985 documentary The Search for <unk> , which has been cited by several authors including Gerald <unk> , an expert on <unk> . 
 Towards the end of the song , there is a line "" Feeding off the screams of the <unk> he 's creating "" , which was taken from the film The Boys from Brazil in which Dr. <unk> was the villain . 
 
 = = Controversy = = 
 
 The lyrical content of "" Angel of Death "" contributed to the delay of the release of Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The band were signed to Def Jam Records whose distributor , Columbia Records , refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns , deeming the artwork "" too graphic "" . Reign in Blood was eventually distributed by Geffen Records on October 7 , 1986 . However , due to the controversy , Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records official release schedule . 
 "" Angel of Death "" caused outrage among survivors of the Holocaust , as well as their families and the general public . The controversy led to accusations of Nazi <unk> which have followed Slayer throughout their career . People took Hanneman 's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals as evidence of <unk> – his most prized item being a German Knight 's Cross . Hanneman <unk> asserting : 
 "" I know why people <unk> it – it 's because they get this knee – <unk> reaction to it . When they read the lyrics , there 's nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man , because to me – well , isn 't that obvious ? I shouldn 't have to tell you that . "" 
 According to guitarist Kerry King : "" Yeah , ' Slayer are Nazis , fascists , communists ' — all that fun shit . And of course we got the most <unk> for it in Germany . I was always like , ' Read the lyrics and tell me what 's offensive about it . Can you see it as a documentary , or do you think Slayer 's preaching fucking World War II ? ' People get this thought in their heads — especially in Europe — and you 'll never talk them out of it . "" 
 The song drew accusations of racism , which the band has denied . The band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews , and have stated numerous times that they do not <unk> racism and are merely interested in the subject . 
 In 2006 , the song "" <unk> "" from Slayer 's 2006 album Christ Illusion drew comparison to "" Angel of Death "" . "" <unk> "" deals with the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , and tells the story from a terrorist 's perspective . <unk> Araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of "" Angel of Death "" , although it did not <unk> , in part , he believes , due to peoples ' view that the song is "" just Slayer being Slayer "" .

 "" Angel of Death "" is the longest track on the album Reign in Blood , spanning 4 minutes and 51 seconds , where the total duration of the album is 29 minutes . Additionally , it has one of the most conventional song structures on the album , featuring prominent verses and choruses , where most tracks on the album <unk> them . Hanneman and King deliver their ' intricate riffs ' , which offer the few hints of melody on the album according to PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand , and Araya bursts out his piercing scream , with Lombardo performing beats of 210 beats per minute . 
 When drummer Lombardo left Slayer in 1992 , the band hired a full @-@ time replacement in Forbidden drummer Paul <unk> . <unk> made one mistake out of the nine songs the band <unk> him with , on "" Angel of Death "" .

 <unk> <unk> b ( abbreviated <unk> <unk> b , <unk> And b ) , occasionally designated <unk> <unk> <unk> ( to distinguish it from the red dwarf <unk> <unk> B ) , also named <unk> , is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light @-@ years away from the Sun in the constellation of <unk> . The planet orbits the Solar twin star , <unk> <unk> A , approximately every five days . Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey <unk> and R. Paul Butler , it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered . It is also one of the first non @-@ resolved planets to be detected directly . <unk> <unk> b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system . 
 In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . In December 2015 , the IAU announced the winning name was <unk> for this planet . The winning name was submitted by the Vega <unk> Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al @-@ <unk> of Muslim Spain . 
 
 = = Discovery = = 
 
 Like the majority of known extrasolar planets , <unk> <unk> b was detected by the variations in its star 's radial velocity caused by the planet 's gravity . The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the <unk> shift of <unk> <unk> 's spectrum . The planet 's existence was announced in January 1997 , together with 55 <unk> b and the planet orbiting <unk> <unk> . 
 Like 51 <unk> b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , <unk> <unk> b orbits very close to its star , closer than Mercury does to our Sun . The planet takes 4 @.@ <unk> days to complete an orbit , with a <unk> axis of 0 @.@ <unk> AU . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect <unk> <unk> b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found . In the case of <unk> <unk> b , this lower limit is 68 @.@ 7 % of the mass of Jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater . However , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around 25 ° and the true mass may be about 1 @.@ 4 MJ . <unk> is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees . 
 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 
 Given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that <unk> <unk> b is a gas giant with no solid surface . 
 The <unk> Space Telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the two sides of <unk> <unk> b of about 1 @,@ 400 degrees <unk> , ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1 @,@ 400 to 1 @,@ 650 degrees <unk> . The temperature difference has led to speculation that <unk> <unk> b is <unk> locked with the same side always facing <unk> <unk> A. 
 <unk> had , on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium , predicted <unk> <unk> b to have reflective clouds of <unk> and iron in its upper atmosphere . The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun 's radiation ; between that and the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a <unk> of cooler gas . The outer shell of dark , <unk> , hot cloud is assumed to consist of <unk> and <unk> oxides ( "" <unk> planets "" ) , but other compounds like <unk> cannot be ruled out yet . 
 The planet is unlikely to have large moons , since <unk> forces would either <unk> them from orbit or destroy them on short <unk> compared to the age of the system . 
 The planet ( with 51 <unk> b ) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by <unk> . Preliminary results from <unk> studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is 1 @.@ 36 times as large and 0 @.@ 74 times as massive as Jupiter , meaning that the mean density is <unk> / cm3 . It has a <unk> albedo of 0 @.@ 35 in visible light . 
 
 = = <unk> on its sun = = 
 
 <unk> <unk> b appears to be responsible for increased <unk> activity on its parent star . Observations suggest that there is a "" hot spot "" on the star around 169 ° away from the sub @-@ planetary point . This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star . The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of <unk> <unk> <unk> variable stars , or the interaction between Jupiter and its moon Io .

 = First <unk> invasion of Burma = 
 
 The first <unk> invasions of Burma ( <unk> ) ( <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> – <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> – <unk> ) ) were a series of military conflicts between <unk> Khan 's Yuan dynasty , division of the <unk> Empire , and the Pagan Empire that took place between <unk> and <unk> . The invasions toppled the 250 @-@ year @-@ old Pagan Empire , and the <unk> army seized Pagan territories in present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> and northern Burma to <unk> . The invasions <unk> in 250 years of political fragmentation in Burma and the rise of Tai @-@ Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia . 
 The Mongols first demanded tribute from Pagan in 1271 – 72 , as part of their drive to encircle the Song dynasty of China . When King <unk> refused , Emperor <unk> Khan himself sent another mission in <unk> , again demanding tribute . It too was rejected . In 1275 , the emperor ordered the <unk> government to secure the <unk> in order to block an escape path for the Song , and permitted a limited border war if Pagan contested . Pagan did contest but its army was driven back at the frontier by the <unk> Army in <unk> – 78 . After a brief lull , <unk> Khan in 1281 turned his attention to Southeast Asia , demanding tribute from Pagan , the Khmer Empire , <unk> <unk> and <unk> . When the <unk> king again refused , the emperor ordered an invasion of northern Burma . Two dry season campaigns ( <unk> – 85 ) later , the Mongols had occupied down to <unk> and <unk> , forcing the <unk> king to flee to Lower Burma . The Mongols organized northern Burma as the province of <unk> . 
 <unk> negotiations began in <unk> , and ended with <unk> finally agreeing to submit in June <unk> . The <unk> embassy , received by the emperor in Beijing in January <unk> , agreed to a treaty that acknowledged the <unk> of the Yuan dynasty or the <unk> Empire over the Pagan Empire and annual payments in taxes to the <unk> government in exchange for the evacuation of <unk> troops from northern Burma . But the treaty never really took effect as <unk> was assassinated in July <unk> , and no authority who could honor the treaty emerged . The <unk> command at <unk> now deemed the imperial order to withdraw void , and ordered an invasion of central Burma . They may not have reached Pagan , and even if they did , after having suffered heavy casualties , they returned to <unk> . 
 The Pagan Empire <unk> and anarchy ensued . The Mongols , who probably preferred the situation , did nothing to restore order in the next ten years . In March <unk> , they accepted the voluntary submission of King <unk> of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan ( <unk> ) . But <unk> was overthrown nine months later , and the Mongols were forced to intervene , leading to their second invasion in 1300 – 01 . 
 Marco Polo reported the first invasions ( <unk> – 87 ) in his <unk> , Il <unk> . The <unk> referred to the invaders as the <unk> ( after the central Asian <unk> troops that largely made up the <unk> invasion army ) ; today , the term <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) refers to the Han Chinese instead . King <unk> is <unk> remembered in <unk> history as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , ( "" the King who <unk> from the <unk> "" ) .

 In the 13th century , the Pagan Empire , along with the Khmer Empire , was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia . For much of its history , Pagan 's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent <unk> Kingdom and its predecessor <unk> , both with <unk> as their capital city . <unk> @-@ based kingdoms were a power in their own right , at times <unk> themselves with the <unk> Empire to their west and at other times with China 's Tang and Song dynasties . Indeed , <unk> 's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself . 
 Between the newly conquered <unk> territory and Pagan were a wide <unk> of <unk> stretching from present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> and <unk> prefectures in <unk> as well as the <unk> and <unk> regions ( presumably in present @-@ day northern Shan State ) , which Pagan and <unk> had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence . Then as now , the <unk> mostly consist of <unk> <unk> of high mountain ranges .

 The <unk> Empire first arrived at the <unk> of the Pagan Empire in <unk> by invading the <unk> Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China . The <unk> armies captured the capital , <unk> , on 7 January <unk> , and went on to <unk> much of the kingdom by <unk> . 
 The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the <unk> as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song . For the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India . The Mongols set up military garrisons , manned mostly by <unk> @-@ speaking Muslims from Central Asia , in 37 circuits of the former <unk> Kingdom . 
 
 = = = Decline of Pagan = = = 
 
 By then , the Pagan Empire , despite outward appearances of calm , had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century . The continuous growth of tax @-@ free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom . The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges . Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in <unk> – 60 in South <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) , the decline continued . On the eve of the <unk> invasions , between one and two @-@ thirds of Upper Burma 's <unk> land had been donated to religion . The crown 's ability to <unk> defenses was in serious jeopardy .

 The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early <unk> . By then , the Song were on the ropes , and Emperor <unk> Khan , who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271 , sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions . In Pagan 's case , he had ordered the <unk> governor of <unk> to <unk> control of the <unk> , and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute . The tribute he demanded was nominal . Given his higher priority <unk> elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan . At the border , the ruler of the <unk> and <unk> regions submitted to the Mongols . 
 When the <unk> envoys led by <unk> <unk> showed up , the Pagan court led by Chief Minister <unk> <unk> was well aware of the military power of the Mongols and advised King <unk> to use diplomacy . The king was furious at the demand and kept the <unk> envoys waiting for weeks . The court finally devised a compromise : the envoys were sent back without ever seeing the king . <unk> them was a <unk> envoy who carried a letter expressing friendly sentiments and the <unk> king 's wish to one day worship a Buddha tooth at Beijing . The king then promptly ordered an expedition , which retook the rebellious <unk> regions in April <unk> . The rebel leader A @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) was brought back to Pagan . <unk> relayed the news to Beijing but did not carry out any military action . 
 
 = = = Second <unk> mission ( <unk> ) = = = 
 
 At Beijing , <unk> Khan , who was preparing an invasion of Japan , decided against a war with Pagan — for the time being . On 3 March <unk> , he sent a 4 @-@ member delegation led by an imperial ambassador , the First Secretary to the Board <unk> , to Pagan . The delegation carried a letter from the emperor . The letter says : 
 "" If you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the All @-@ Highest , send one of your brothers or senior ministers , to show men that all the world is linked with Us , and enter into a perpetual alliance . This will add to your reputation , and be in your own interests ; for if it comes to war , who will be the victor ? <unk> well , O king , Our words . "" 
 This time , the <unk> king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit . ( The <unk> chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed . But both <unk> <unk> evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed . ) At any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to <unk> in due time . The newly formed <unk> government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route . 
 
 = = = <unk> consolidation of <unk> ( 1275 – 76 ) = = = 
 
 Meanwhile , in <unk> , the former <unk> Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> al @-@ Din Omar as governor . In May 1275 , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned ; that the <unk> evidently had no intention of submitting ; and that war was the only way forward . 
 But the emperor rejected an outright invasion . Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair . He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song ; the emperor ordered the <unk> provincial army to secure the <unk> in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees . He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover . As planned , the <unk> army proceeded to consolidate the <unk> in 1275 – 76 . ( Elsewhere , the main <unk> armies had captured most of the Song territory by <unk> . ) 
 By <unk> , at least one <unk> vassal state named "" Gold <unk> "" ( modern <unk> ) had submitted to the Mongols . Like in <unk> , the <unk> government responded by sending an army to reclaim the rebellious state ; but unlike in <unk> , the Mongols had posted a sizable garrison there . Though it was ultimately under <unk> command , many of the officers and most of the soldiers of the garrison were <unk> @-@ speaking peoples or people from the further west : Turks from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , but also captive soldiers from the Persian <unk> empire , the <unk> , and even <unk> from the lower <unk> .

 What followed was a border war in <unk> – 78 . It was reported mainly in the Yuan dynasty chronicle and the <unk> of Marco Polo . Although the <unk> chronicles have no record of the border war , a <unk> <unk> inscription mentions the army 's defeat at <unk> . The <unk> accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate . 
 
 = = = Battle of <unk> = = = 
 
 According to the Yuan dynasty chronicle and Marco Polo 's accounts , a <unk> army "" invaded "" the <unk> territory of Gold <unk> , and was defeated by the <unk> army in April <unk> . The battle took place either at the <unk> valley ( in present @-@ day <unk> Prefecture ) or 110 km southwest at <unk> ( present @-@ day <unk> , <unk> Prefecture ) , which the <unk> called <unk> . 
 The Yuan Chronicle reports that only 700 men defeated a <unk> army of 40 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 with 10 @,@ 000 horses and 800 <unk> . It also reports only one <unk> was killed , in trying to catch an elephant . According to Marco Polo , the <unk> army consisted of 12 @,@ 000 mounted <unk> , and the <unk> army numbered 60 @,@ 000 men with 2000 <unk> , "" on each of which was set a tower of timber , well @-@ framed and strong , and carrying from 12 to 16 well @-@ armed fighting men . "" Even then , the 40 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 figures of the <unk> army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high ; the Mongols may have <unk> "" on the side of generosity "" not to "" <unk> their glory in defeating superior numbers . "" 
 According to Marco Polo 's account , in the early stages of the battle , the Turkish and <unk> horsemen "" took such <unk> at the sight of the <unk> that they would not be got to face the <unk> , but always <unk> and turned back , "" while the <unk> forces pressed on . But the <unk> commander <unk> did not panic ; he ordered his troops to <unk> , and from the cover of the nearby <unk> , aim their bows directly at the advancing <unk> . The <unk> <unk> ' arrows threw the animals into such pain that they fled .

 The <unk> army pressed on after the monsoon season . In the following dry season of <unk> – 78 , c .

They occupied the fort and destroyed a large number of abandoned <unk> . But they found the heat excessive and returned .

 Despite the <unk> military success , the control of the <unk> remained contested . Pagan did not relinquish its claim to the frontier regions , and the <unk> , apparently taking advantage of <unk> <unk> elsewhere , rebuilt their forts at <unk> and <unk> later in <unk> , posting permanent garrisons commanded by <unk> <unk> . But their control was short @-@ lived . The Great Khan 's attention turned to Southeast Asia once more in 1281 . He had had mixed success : his <unk> forces had finished off the last of the Song in 1279 but had again failed to take Japan in 1281 . That year , the <unk> emperor sent another mission to Pagan , demanding tribute yet again . The <unk> king was to send his ten senior ministers accompanied by one thousand cavalry officers to the emperor 's court . ( With <unk> , the emperor summoned the king of <unk> himself to Beijing . ) 
 At Pagan , <unk> <unk> with his court for an appropriate response but ultimately refused to submit . The <unk> court may have been counting on another limited border war but the emperor now ordered an invasion of northern Burma . ( He also ordered an invasion of <unk> , whose king too had refused to submit . ) The <unk> king 's troubles did not go <unk> elsewhere in the kingdom . In the same year , a <unk> named <unk> seized the southern port city of <unk> ( <unk> ) by killing its Pagan @-@ appointed governor . Although the king 's three sons were <unk> of the nearby Lower Burma cities ( in <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , and <unk> ) , the king , preoccupied with much more serious threat in the north , did not ( or could not ) take any action on <unk> . 
 Throughout <unk> , the <unk> command made preparations for the upcoming invasions of <unk> and northern Burma . The objective of the Burma campaign was to take over northern Burma but no further ; the emperor did not <unk> an attack on Pagan itself . At least one army consisted of 14 @,@ 000 men of the <unk> Persian <unk> Empire under the command of <unk> <unk> was sent to <unk> to reinforce the Burma invasion force , which again was made up of Turks and other central <unk> . On the <unk> side , the king managed to raise an army although given his low standing with his vassals , he probably could not have raised a large one . By mid @-@ <unk> , a <unk> army led by generals <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> was deployed at a fort at <unk> .

 The invasion began on 22 September <unk> . Prince <unk> was the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the invasion force ; his deputies were Vice Governor <unk> , and commander <unk> <unk> . The <unk> armies marched to the border in two columns . One column advanced along the <unk> River using over 200 boats ; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the <unk> fort at <unk> . The <unk> chronicles report an overwhelming number of <unk> forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated . ( The chronicles say that the <unk> army numbered 400 @,@ 000 men while the <unk> army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses . ) The <unk> withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December <unk> .

 The defeat at <unk> broke the back of <unk> defenses . The <unk> army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders . <unk> , the next fort <unk> , fell just six days later on 9 December <unk> . The <unk> sources say that the <unk> lost 10 @,@ 000 men at <unk> . The <unk> armies pushed farther south into the <unk> valley . They took the ancient <unk> capital of <unk> , about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February <unk> . There , the invaders paused their advance . They found the heat of the searing <unk> valley excessive , and evacuated <unk> , allowing the <unk> to return to <unk> on 10 May <unk> . But the <unk> army renewed their offensive in the following dry season . They retook <unk> , and defeated another <unk> stand south of <unk> , probably near <unk> , on 26 January <unk> , opening the way to Pagan , about 270 km south . After the defeat , the king <unk> , and fled to Lower Burma . The evacuation proved premature . The <unk> forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan . 
 The country fell into chaos . In Lower Burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack . Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , the king did not trust any of them , and he and his court settled at <unk> , west of <unk> . Without the full support of his sons , the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one . The governor of <unk> <unk> that same year . The king managed to send two small expeditions to <unk> but they both failed . Now , the entire eastern half of Lower Burma ( <unk> and <unk> ) was in open revolt .

 Given his precarious position , <unk> decided to buy time , and sue for peace with the Mongols . In November / December <unk> , the king ordered his generals <unk> <unk> and <unk> Bo to enter into ceasefire negotiations . The <unk> commanders at <unk> , who had organized northern Burma as a protectorate named <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , agreed to a ceasefire but insisted on a full submission . They repeated their 1281 demand that the <unk> king send a formal delegation to the emperor . The two sides had reached a tentative agreement by 3 March <unk> , which calls for a full submission of the Pagan Empire , and central Burma to be organized as the province of <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : <unk> @-@ Chung ) . After a long <unk> , the king agreed to submit but wanted the <unk> troops to withdraw . In June <unk> , he sent an embassy led by Shin <unk> <unk> , a learned monk , to the emperor 's court .

 In January <unk> , the embassy arrived at Beijing , and was received by the Yuan emperor . The <unk> delegation formally acknowledged <unk> <unk> of their kingdom , and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country . ( Indeed , the tribute was no longer nominal . ) In exchange , the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops . For the emperor , the Burma campaign was the only bright spot ; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly . He did not want to invest more troops <unk> the rest of the kingdom . He preferred a vassal ruler . The <unk> embassy arrived back at <unk> in May <unk> , and reported the terms to the king .

 But the agreement broke down a month later . In late June , the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan . But on 1 July <unk> , the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son <unk> , the Viceroy of <unk> . Anarchy ensued . Each region in the country which had not <unk> broke away . No successor to <unk> , who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of Beijing , emerged . Indeed , a king would not emerge until May <unk> . 
 
 = = <unk> intervention ( <unk> ) = = 
 
 Given the chaos , the governor of <unk> ignored the imperial orders of evacuation . The <unk> army commanded by Prince <unk> @-@ sin <unk> , a grandson of the emperor , marched south toward Pagan . According to mainstream traditional ( British colonial era ) scholarship , the <unk> army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate ; fought its way down to Pagan with the loss of 7000 men ; occupied the city ; and sent out <unk> to receive homage , one of which reached south of <unk> . But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary <unk> / Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary <unk> of the conquest . 
 Recent research shows that the <unk> forces most probably never reached Pagan . They were held at bay by the <unk> defenses led by commanders <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and probably never got closer than 160 km north of Pagan . ( An inscription dated 16 February <unk> by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the <unk> army . ) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . At any rate , the <unk> army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to <unk> . They remained there as the treaty was now void . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 The disintegration of the Pagan Empire was now complete . But the Mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created . They would send no more expeditions to restore order . The emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to <unk> the fragmented country . Indeed , his real aim all along may have been "" to keep the entire region of Southeast Asia broken and fragmented . "" It would be another two years until one of <unk> 's sons , <unk> , emerged as king of Pagan in May <unk> . But the new "" king "" controlled just a small area around the capital , and had no real army . The real power in central Burma now rested with the three commander brothers . 
 The uneasy arrangement would persist until <unk> . The Mongols continued to occupy northern Burma to <unk> as the province of <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) but ended the fictional central Burma province of <unk> on 18 August <unk> . Meanwhile , the power struggle in central Burma continued with the three brothers <unk> consolidating support . To check their rising power , <unk> submitted to the Mongols in January <unk> , and was recognized by the Yuan emperor <unk> Khan as King of Pagan on 20 March <unk> . The emperor also gave Chinese titles to the brothers as subordinates of <unk> . The brothers resented the new arrangement as it directly reduced their power . On 17 December <unk> , the three brothers <unk> <unk> , and founded the <unk> Kingdom . The <unk> forced the <unk> government to intervene again , leading to the second <unk> invasion of Burma ( 1300 – 01 ) . The invasion failed . Two years later , on 4 April <unk> , the Mongols abolished the province of <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) , evacuated <unk> , and returned to <unk> .

 The war was one of several near simultaneous wars <unk> by the <unk> Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century . Though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the Mongols , the war set off a series of enduring developments in Burma . The invasions <unk> in a period of political fragmentation , and the rise of Tai @-@ Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia . 
 
 = = = Age of political fragmentation = = = 
 
 The immediate result of the war was the collapse of the Pagan Empire . However , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it . Pagan 's disintegration was "" in fact more prolonged and <unk> . "" The kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century . Had Pagan possessed a stronger central government , the collapse could have been temporary , and the country “ could have risen again ” . But the dynasty could not recover , and because the Mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath . As a result , several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century . It was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the <unk> basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy . The vast region surrounding the <unk> valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai @-@ Shan states well into the 16th century . 
 
 = = = Rise of Tai @-@ Shan states = = = 
 
 Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the <unk> invasions was the emergence of Tai @-@ Shan states in mainland Southeast Asia . The Tai @-@ Shan people who came down with the <unk> invasions stayed . By the early 14th century , several Tai @-@ Shan states had come to dominate a vast region from present @-@ day <unk> to northern and eastern <unk> to northern and central Thailand and Laos . Their rise was encouraged by the Mongols , who viewed the states as a useful <unk> between <unk> and the rest of Southeast Asia . The Mongols , who were still trying to incorporate <unk> into the central administration , were unwilling or unable to make necessary sustained investments to bring the vast regions south of <unk> into the fold . ( The integration of <unk> itself into “ China <unk> ” was to take several more centuries , and continues to today . ) As such , from the newly formed Tai @-@ Shan states in western and central Southeast Asia to Dai Viet and <unk> in eastern Southeast Asia , the Mongols elected to receive nominal tribute . Though the rulers of these states were technically governors of the Yuan government , they were the native chieftains , “ who would have ruled there in any case , and they did as they pleased . ”

 The war also marked the arrival of China at the <unk> of Burma . The old <unk> Kingdom , known to the <unk> as <unk> ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , after <unk> Raj ) was now a <unk> Chinese province .

Today , King <unk> is remembered as <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> , ( "" the King who fled from the <unk> [ Chinese ] ) . ) From a <unk> standpoint , the <unk> – Chinese presence in <unk> pushed the Shan migrations in the direction of Burma ( and parts of the Khmer Empire ) .

 = = History = = 
 
 The current route was originally legislated in 1911 as part of the Delaware River Drive , a named state highway that was proposed to run from along the Delaware River from <unk> to the New York border in <unk> Township . Route 29 was originally defined in 1927 to run from <unk> to Newark . The original route ran from downtown <unk> along State Street and <unk> Drive . From there , it followed its current alignment to <unk> , where it followed present @-@ day Route 179 to <unk> to present @-@ day County Route <unk> , which it followed to Woods Tavern . The route turned north on U.S. Route 206 ( also designated Route 31 ) and followed that route to <unk> , where it followed U.S. Route 22 to Newark . The current alignment of Route 29 from <unk> to Route 12 in Frenchtown was designated Route <unk> in 1927 . 
 The alignment of Route 29 between <unk> and <unk> was eventually shifted to follow present @-@ day U.S. Route 202 , which was also Route 30 ( now Route 31 ) between <unk> and Flemington and Route 12 between Flemington and <unk> . In 1938 , Route <unk> was planned as an extension of Route <unk> from Frenchtown to Route 28 ( now Route 122 ) in Alpha . While this road was never built , much of the alignment north of Milford is served by County Route <unk> . In 1948 , a spur route , Route <unk> , was created , running along U.S. Route 202 ( Bridge Street ) in <unk> to the New Hope @-@ <unk> Bridge . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 29 was <unk> to continue north from <unk> to Frenchtown on Route <unk> , and the Route 29 designation between <unk> and Newark was removed in favor of U.S. Route 202 between <unk> and <unk> and U.S. Route 22 between <unk> and Newark . The section of former Route 29 between Route <unk> and Route <unk> became Route 165 . 
 Plans for a limited @-@ access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between <unk> and <unk> ; this proposal never materialized . Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road , the John Fitch Parkway , that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in <unk> to present @-@ day Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . Construction of this portion John Fitch Parkway took up much of <unk> ’ s available waterfront along the Delaware River . The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of <unk> and in Ewing Township became Route 175 . 
 Between 1990 and 1995 , the Route 29 freeway was built between the Interstate 195 / Interstate 295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township . A two @-@ lane street , <unk> Road , connected the two freeway sections . Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in <unk> . Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the <unk> @-@ <unk> Railroad Bridge . The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River . The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel . The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2 , 2002 . A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002 . 
 By the 2000s , the state gave the part of Route 29 ( South Main Street ) between Route 165 and Route 179 in <unk> to the city , and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179 . Prior to this , South Main Street had been turned one @-@ way southbound . Route 165 , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with Route 29 .

 The release of Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone ( released as Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone in the United States ) took place in 2001 . <unk> received a seven figure salary for the lead role , but asserted that the fee was "" not that important "" to him ; his parents chose to invest the money for him .

 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Frank Black ( Lance <unk> ) and Emma Hollis ( <unk> Scott ) travel to <unk> Rest , South Carolina to investigate the deaths of film director Lew Carroll ( Paul Stanley ) and Marta <unk> , the leading actress in his newest film .

 The pair interview the cast and crew as suspects , discovering that many would benefit from either of the deaths — producer Kenny <unk> had been having an affair with <unk> ; <unk> <unk> replaced Carroll as director ; Ruby Dahl and <unk> <unk> , whose roles in the film will expand without <unk> ; and Mark Bianco , a method actor <unk> the opportunity to meet Black , whose role he plays .

 "" ... Thirteen Years Later "" is the second episode of Millennium to have been written by Michael R.

Wright would also go on to direct "" Millennium "" , the series ' crossover episode with its sister show The X @-@ Files . 
 The episode features guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss — Peter Criss , Ace <unk> , Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley — who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role . However , the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue , which led to Perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and <unk> updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode . Ace <unk> was also <unk> towards his role , and requested to play a "" 300 @-@ pound black man "" instead , wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the 1996 Eddie Murphy film The <unk> Professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to <unk> . 
 Perry has described the production "" ... Thirteen Years Later "" as being "" one of the most <unk> "" of the series ' run , citing its abundance of stunt work and physical effects as the cause of this . Perry praised Wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints , as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode .

At this crossing , the road runs closely parallel to a <unk> <unk> <unk> Operations railroad line before entering Petersburg , where it splits from the railroad tracks and comes to a <unk> with CR 610 . Upon leaving Petersburg , Route 50 turns to the north again and crosses over the <unk> <unk> <unk> Operations railroad line , intersecting CR <unk> . It continues to <unk> and comes to CR <unk> . Past this intersection , the route meets CR <unk> and CR <unk> . Route 50 forms a concurrency with CR <unk> and the two routes head north and encounter the eastern terminus of Route 49 before leaving <unk> . 
 Not far after Route 49 , the road crosses the <unk> River into <unk> City , Atlantic County . In <unk> City , it heads into residential areas , with CR <unk> <unk> to the west of the route . Route 50 and CR <unk> continue northwest and intersect CR 648 , where the road turns north into more forested areas . At the junction with CR 645 , the route turns to the northeast and enters <unk> Manor , becoming Broad Street . CR <unk> splits from Route 50 by heading northwest on Buena <unk> Road and Route 50 heads through some agricultural <unk> concurrent with CR <unk> Truck , passing to the west of the <unk> Wildlife Area , which is known as a breeding ground for several species of birds . The route intersects CR <unk> , turning to the northeast . 
 After passing some homes and Stephen Lake , the road turns to the north and passes to the west of <unk> Manor County Park . The route crosses the South River into <unk> Township , passing the residential community of <unk> to the east and meeting CR <unk> . It soon enters Hamilton Township , where the name of the road becomes Mill Street and it comes to a junction with US 40 ( Harding Highway ) . CR <unk> Truck heads to the west on US 40 at this point while Route 50 heads east on US 40 , and CR <unk> continues north . 
 US 40 and <unk> 50 follow the Harding Highway , a two @-@ lane undivided road , turning to the northeast and crossing the Great <unk> Harbor River . Upon passing over the river , enters Mays Landing and turns north , encountering CR <unk> before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of Mays Landing . Here , the road crosses CR <unk> , and US 40 splits from <unk> 50 by turning east along that road . Meanwhile , Route 50 continues north on Cape May Avenue , passing through developed areas .

 Past this interchange , Route 50 <unk> to a four @-@ lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway . The route becomes a two @-@ lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas , crossing into Galloway Township , where there is an intersection with CR <unk> .

 = Military history of Australia = 
 
 The military history of Australia spans the nation 's 220 @-@ year modern history , from the early Australian frontier wars between <unk> and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 21st century . Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity , including the Anzac spirit . The relationship between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of Australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma . 
 As British <unk> , the Australian colonies participated in Britain 's small wars of the 19th century , while later as a <unk> dominion , and then an independent nation , Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War , as well as in the wars in Korea , Malaya , Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War . In the Post @-@ Vietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions , through the United Nations and other agencies , including in the Sinai , Persian Gulf , <unk> , Somalia , East Timor and the Solomon Islands , while more recently they have also fought as part of multi @-@ lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan . In total , nearly 103 @,@ 000 Australians died during the course of these conflicts . 
 
 = = War and Australian society = = 
 
 For most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males , and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century , it continues to influence Australian society to this day . War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history , while a major part of the national identity has been built on an <unk> conception of the Australian experience of war and of <unk> , known as the Anzac spirit . These ideals include notions of endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; traits which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War . The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity . 
 The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture : <unk> with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare . Indeed , Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942 , while since then an alliance with the United States has <unk> its security . <unk> , this pattern of <unk> — both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more <unk> security concerns — has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies . Regardless , a tendency towards strategic <unk> has also been evident , with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to <unk> resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which has historically resulted in <unk> for major military challenges . 
 Reflecting both the realist and liberal <unk> of international relations and the conception of national interests , a number of other important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious . Such themes include : an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics , the <unk> of notions of <unk> sovereignty , a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a <unk> of security , and the proposition that the status <unk> in international affairs should only be changed peacefully . Likewise , <unk> , collective security and defence self @-@ reliance have also been important themes . Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic <unk> have persisted throughout its history , being the product of Australian society 's democratic political tradition and <unk> @-@ Christian Anglo @-@ European heritage , as well its associated values , beliefs and economic , political and religious ideology . These <unk> are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island on the edge of the Asia @-@ Pacific , and the <unk> circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power . To be sure , during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result , it has frequently become involved in foreign wars . Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers — known colloquially as <unk> — have often been noted , somewhat <unk> , for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities .

 = = = British Forces in Australia , 1788 – 1870 = = = 
 
 From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces . Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island , however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the New South Wales Corps . The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804 . Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van <unk> 's Land . Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 . As a result , in January 1810 the 73rd ( <unk> ) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia . By 1870 , 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia , as had a small number of artillery and engineer units . 
 Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack , no actual threat ever <unk> . The British Army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , combating <unk> , putting down convict rebellions — as occurred at Bathurst in 1830 — and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement . Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the <unk> <unk> in 1854 on the Victorian <unk> . Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India , Afghanistan , New Zealand and the Sudan . 
 During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by detached Royal Navy units of the East Indies Station , based in Sydney . However , in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a <unk> , marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia . The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913 , when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy ; the Royal Navy 's depots , dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people . 
 
 = = = Frontier warfare , 1788 – 1934 = = = 
 
 The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied , but were inevitably hostile when the settler 's presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants ' lands . European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations , and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation . By and large neither the British nor the <unk> approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare . At times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units . Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands , while many <unk> served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes . 
 Fighting between <unk> and Europeans was localised as the <unk> did not form <unk> capable of sustained resistance . As a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent . <unk> or disorganised however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century . This warfare <unk> the popular and at times academic "" myth "" of peaceful settlement in Australia . Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres . Among the most famous is the Battle of <unk> in Western Australia in 1834 . Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the <unk> Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings . However , in Tasmania the so @-@ called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832 , and aimed at driving most of the island 's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas . Although it began in failure for the British , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population . 
 It may be inaccurate though to depict the conflict as one sided and mainly <unk> by Europeans on <unk> . Although many more <unk> died than British , this may have had more to do with the technological and logistic advantages enjoyed by the Europeans . Aboriginal tactics varied , but were mainly based on pre @-@ existing hunting and fighting practices — using <unk> , clubs and other primitive weapons . Unlike the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and North America , on the main <unk> failed to adapt to meet the challenge of the Europeans . Although there were some instances of individuals and groups acquiring and using firearms , this was not widespread . The <unk> were never a serious military threat to European settlers , regardless of how much the settlers may have feared them . On occasions large groups of <unk> attacked the settlers in open terrain and a conventional battle ensued , during which the <unk> would attempt to use superior numbers to their advantage . This could sometimes be effective , with reports of them advancing in crescent formation in an attempt to outflank and surround their opponents , waiting out the first volley of shots and then hurling their <unk> while the settlers <unk> . However , such open warfare usually proved more costly for the <unk> than the Europeans . 
 Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms . However , the advantages afforded by firearms have often been <unk> . Prior to the late 19th century , firearms were often <unk> muzzle @-@ loading , smooth @-@ bore , single shot <unk> with flint @-@ lock mechanisms . Such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . These deficiencies may have initially given the <unk> an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with <unk> or clubs . Yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage , with the six @-@ shot <unk> revolver , the <unk> single shot breech @-@ loading rifle and later the <unk> @-@ Henry rifle , as well as rapid @-@ fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle , becoming available . These weapons , when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of <unk> , often proved successful . The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast @-@ moving , often hidden enemies . Tactics employed included night @-@ time surprise attacks , and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks . 
 The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia . Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May 1788 , it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s . As the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback New South Wales in the 1840s . In Tasmania , fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s , while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia , the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s . The south @-@ west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850 . The war in Queensland began in the area around Brisbane in the 1840s and continued until 1860 , moving to central Queensland in the 1850s and 1860s , and then to northern Queensland from the 1860s to 1900 . In Western Australia , the violence moved north with European settlement , reaching the <unk> region by 1880 , with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s . In the Northern Territory conflict lasted even later still , especially in central Australia , continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s . One estimate of casualties places European deaths at 2 @,@ 500 , while at least 20 @,@ 000 <unk> are believed to have perished . Far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the Aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century ; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist .

The conflict was over by 1864 , and the <unk> Regiments disbanded in 1867 .

 = = = Colonial military forces , 1870 – 1901 = = = 
 
 From 1870 until 1901 , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence . The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 , and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs , the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia . To do this , they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces . Initially these were militias in support of British regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870 , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities . The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component . They were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline . Even after significant reforms in the 1870s — including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units — they remained too small and <unk> to be considered armies in the modern sense . By 1885 , the forces numbered 21 @,@ 000 men . Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising <unk> to serve in Sudan , South Africa and China . 
 Despite a reputation of colonial <unk> , many of the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained . During this period , defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts . However , by the 1890s , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards — who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces — to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid <unk> of brigades of infantry . As a consequence he called for a <unk> of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies . Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be <unk> and for professional units — obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific — to replace the volunteer forces . These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant , Major General Edward Hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria <unk> the proposal . These reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies . 
 With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel , <unk> Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First <unk> War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas . The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad <unk> Cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats . New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats and a <unk> . The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , HMCS Protector . Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery . Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the <unk> Rebellion in China in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action . The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia . 
 
 = = = Sudan , 1885 = = = 
 
 During the early years of the 1880s , an Egyptian regime in the Sudan , backed by the British , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad ( or Ahmed ) , known as Mahdi to his followers . In 1883 , as part of the <unk> War , the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of <unk> their forces . The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan , and sent General Charles Gordon to co @-@ <unk> the evacuation , but he was killed in January 1885 . When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885 , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent 's expenses . The New South Wales <unk> consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers , and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885 . 
 The contingent arrived in <unk> on 29 March and were attached to a brigade that consisted of Scots , <unk> and <unk> Guards . They subsequently marched for <unk> in a large "" square "" formation made up of 10 @,@ 000 men . Reaching the village , they burned <unk> and returned to <unk> : three Australians were wounded in minor fighting . Most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards <unk> , on the Nile . The Australians were then assigned to guard duties , but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered . They <unk> on a reconnaissance to <unk> on 6 May and were heavily involved in a <unk> during which more than 100 Arabs were killed or captured . On 15 May , they made one last sortie to bury the dead from the fighting of the previous March . Meanwhile , the artillery were posted at <unk> and drilled for a month , but they soon rejoined the camp at <unk> . 
 Eventually the British government decided that the campaign in Sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in <unk> . The New South Wales <unk> sailed for home on 17 May , arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885 . Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan ; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign . 
 
 = = = Second Boer War , 1899 – 1902 = = = 
 
 British encroachment into areas of South Africa already settled by the <unk> <unk> and the competition for resources and land that developed between them as a result , led to the Second Boer War in 1899 . Pre @-@ <unk> the deployment of British forces , the <unk> <unk> of the Orange Free State and the <unk> Republic under President Paul <unk> declared war on 11 October 1899 , striking deep into the British territories of Natal and the Cape Colony . After the outbreak of war , plans for the dispatch of a combined Australian force were subsequently set aside by the British War Office and each of the six colonial governments sent separate <unk> to serve with British formations , with two squadrons each of 125 men from New South Wales and Victoria , and one each from the other colonies . The first troops arrived three weeks later , with the New South Wales <unk> — who had been training in England before the war , <unk> diverted to South Africa . On 22 November , the <unk> came under fire for the first time near <unk> , and they subsequently forced their attackers to withdraw after inflicting significant casualties on them . 
 Following a series of minor victories , the British suffered a major setback during Black Week between 10 – 17 December 1899 , although no Australian units were involved . The first <unk> of infantry from Victoria , South Australia , Western Australia , and Tasmania arrived in Cape Town on 26 November and were designated the Australian Regiment under the command of Colonel John Charles <unk> . With a need for increased mobility , they were soon converted into mounted infantry . Further units from Queensland and New South Wales arrived in December and were soon committed to the front . The first casualties occurred soon after at <unk> on 1 January 1900 , after 250 Queensland Mounted Infantry and a column of Canadians , British and artillery attacked a Boer <unk> at <unk> . <unk> David <unk> and Victor Jones were killed when their patrol clashed with the Boer forward <unk> . Regardless , the <unk> were surprised and during two hours of heavy fighting , more than 50 were killed and another 40 taken prisoner . Five hundred <unk> and the New South Wales <unk> subsequently took part in the Siege of <unk> in February 1900 . 
 Despite serious set @-@ backs at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in January — and with <unk> still under siege — the British mounted a five division counter @-@ invasion of the Orange Free State in February . The attacking force included a division of cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales <unk> , Queensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached . First , <unk> was relieved following the battles of <unk> River and <unk> , and the retreating <unk> defeated at <unk> , with the New South Wales Mounted Rifles locating the Boer general , <unk> <unk> . The British entered <unk> on 13 March 1900 , while <unk> was relieved . Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died . Still the advance continued , with the drive to <unk> in May including more than 3 @,@ 000 Australians . Johannesburg fell on 30 May , and the <unk> withdrew from <unk> on 3 June . The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on 12 June . <unk> was relieved on 17 May . 
 Following the defeat of the <unk> republics still the <unk> held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply . This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the <unk> 's <unk> , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse @-@ riding and shooting skills , but little military experience . After Federation in 1901 , eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended . Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units , instead of returning home after discharge . These soldiers were part of the British Army , and were subject to British military discipline . Such units included the <unk> <unk> which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry "" <unk> "" <unk> and Peter <unk> served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes . 
 With the guerrillas requiring supplies , <unk> de la Rey lead a force of 3 @,@ 000 <unk> against <unk> , on the <unk> River in Western <unk> . The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 <unk> . The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties . During the night the defenders dug in , enduring shelling and rifle fire . A relief force was stopped by the <unk> , while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved . The siege lasted 11 days , during which more than 1 @,@ 800 shells were fired into the post . After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders , and not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the <unk> eventually retired . The Siege of <unk> River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war , with the post finally relieved on 16 August . 
 In response the British adopted counter @-@ insurgency tactics , including a <unk> earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops , the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children , and a system of <unk> and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications . Such measures required considerable expenditure , and caused much bitterness towards the British , however they soon yielded results . By mid @-@ 1901 , the bulk of the fighting was over , and British mounted units would ride at night to attack Boer <unk> or <unk> , overwhelming them with superior numbers . <unk> of warfare in last months of 1901 , the New South Wales Mounted Rifles travelled 1 @,@ <unk> miles ( 2 @,@ <unk> km ) and were involved in 13 <unk> , killing 27 <unk> , wounding 15 , and capturing 196 for the loss of five dead and 19 wounded . Other notable Australian actions included <unk> , Pink Hill , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Australians were not always successful however , suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war . On 12 June 1901 , the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at <unk> , near <unk> after poor security allowed a force of 150 <unk> to surprise them . On 30 October 1901 , <unk> of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill , although 60 <unk> were also killed in the engagement . Meanwhile , at <unk> on 4 January 1902 , the 5th Queensland Imperial <unk> lost 13 killed and 17 wounded . Ultimately the <unk> were defeated , and the war ended on 31 May 1902 . In all 16 @,@ 175 Australians served in South Africa , and perhaps another 10 @,@ 000 enlisted as individuals in Imperial units ; casualties included 251 killed in action , 267 died of disease and 43 missing in action , while a further 735 were wounded . Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross . 
 
 = = = <unk> Rebellion , 1900 – 01 = = = 
 
 The <unk> Rebellion in China began in 1900 , and a number of western nations — including many European powers , the United States , and Japan — soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests . In June , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China . The colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower . The force dispatched was a modest one , with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria , 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector , under the command of Captain William <unk> . Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade <unk> , who had been trained in both ship handling and <unk> to fulfil their coastal defence role . Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks , Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War . The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks . The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the <unk> Marine Light Infantry . 
 The <unk> from New South Wales and Victoria sailed for China on 8 August 1900 . Arriving in <unk> , the Australians provided 300 men to an 8 @,@ 000 @-@ strong multinational force tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at <unk> Tang , which dominated a key railway . They arrived too late to take part in the battle , but were involved in the attack on the fortress at <unk> @-@ <unk> Fu , where the Chinese government was believed to have found <unk> after <unk> was captured by western forces . The <unk> joined a force of 7 @,@ 500 men on a ten @-@ day march to the fort , once again only to find that it had already surrendered . The <unk> then garrisoned <unk> and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in <unk> . HMCS Protector was mostly used for survey , transport , and <unk> duties in the Gulf of <unk> , before departing in November . The naval brigades remained during the winter , <unk> performing policing and guard duties , as well as working as <unk> and fire @-@ fighters . They left China in March 1901 , having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order . Six Australians died from sickness and injury , but none were killed as a result of enemy action . 
 
 = = Australian military forces at Federation , 1901 = = 
 
 The Commonwealth of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901 as a result of the federation of the Australian colonies . Under the Constitution of Australia , defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government . The co @-@ ordination of Australia @-@ wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind <unk> , and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result , while the Commonwealth Military Forces ( early forerunner of the Australian Army ) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established . 
 The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces came into being on 1 March 1901 and all the colonial forces — including those still in South Africa — became part of the new force . 28 @,@ <unk> colonial soldiers , including 1 @,@ 457 professional soldiers , 18 @,@ 603 paid militia and 8 @,@ <unk> unpaid volunteers , were subsequently transferred . The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts until the Defence Act 1903 brought all the units under one piece of legislation . This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia . However , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the Citizen Military Forces ( <unk> ) . Major General Sir Edward Hutton — a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces — subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on 26 December and set to work <unk> an integrated structure for the new army . In 1911 , following a report by Lord <unk> the Royal Military College , <unk> was established , as was a system of universal National Service . 
 Prior to federation each self @-@ governing colony had operated its own naval force . These navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to <unk> the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades . The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901 , when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created . This new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy . In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and <unk> , while attending the Imperial Conference in London , sought the British Government 's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy . The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested <unk> that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient . Deakin was unimpressed , and in 1908 invited the American Great White Fleet to visit Australia . This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 @-@ ton River @-@ class destroyers . The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911 , absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force . On 4 October 1913 , the new fleet steamed through Sydney Heads , consisting of the battlecruiser <unk> Australia , three light cruisers , and three destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction . And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force . 
 The Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) was established as part of the Commonwealth Military Forces in 1912 , prior to the formation of the Australian Military Forces in 1916 and was later separated in 1921 to form the Royal Australian Air Force , making it the second oldest air force in the world . Regardless , the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however , and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments .

 When Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War , the Australian government rapidly followed suit , with Prime Minister Joseph Cook declaring on 5 August 1914 that "" ... when the Empire is at war , so also is Australia "" and reflecting the sentiment of many Australians that any declaration of war by Britain automatically included Australia . This was itself in part due to the large number of British @-@ born citizens and first generation Anglo @-@ Australians that made up the Australian population at the time . Indeed , by the end of the war almost 20 % of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in Britain . 
 As the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 , an all @-@ volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) was formed and recruitment began on 10 August 1914 . The government pledged 20 @,@ 000 men , organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units . <unk> and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under <unk> plans drawn up in 1912 . The first commander was Major General William Bridges , who also assumed command of the 1st Division . Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war , although small air and naval forces were also committed .

 Following the outbreak of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany 's Pacific colonies . The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force ( <unk> & <unk> ) , a 2000 @-@ man volunteer force — separate from the AIF — and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval <unk> and ex @-@ sailors , was rapidly formed under the command of William Holmes . The objectives of the force were the wireless stations on <unk> , and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands , and at Rabaul in German New Guinea . The force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and occupied it the next day , encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at <unk> <unk> and <unk> . German New Guinea surrendered on 17 September 1914 . Australian losses were light , including six killed during the fighting , but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine <unk> with all 35 men aboard . 
 
 = = = Gallipoli = = = 
 
 The AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on 1 November 1914 . During the journey one of the convoy 's naval escorts — <unk> Sydney — engaged and destroyed the German cruiser SMS <unk> at the Battle of <unk> on 8 November , in the first ship @-@ to @-@ ship action involving the Royal Australian Navy . Although originally bound for England to undergo further training and then for employment on the Western Front , the Australians were instead sent to British @-@ controlled Egypt to pre @-@ <unk> any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal , and with a view to opening another front against the Central Powers . 
 <unk> to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious <unk> at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British , Indian and French forces committed to the campaign . The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) — commanded by British general William Birdwood — subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915 . Although promising to transform the war if successful , the Gallipoli Campaign was ill @-@ conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives . Australian casualties totalled 26 @,@ 111 , including 8 @,@ 141 killed . 
 For Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity . Today , the date of the initial landings , 25 April , is known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations , as well as Turkey , to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original <unk> , and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war .

 After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion . In 1916 the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks . Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt . The Australian 's first saw combat during the <unk> uprising in the <unk> Desert and the Nile Valley , during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro @-@ Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties . The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between 3 – 5 August 1916 , with the Turks eventually pushed back . Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal . Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917 , while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February . 
 The advance entered Palestine and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made to capture Gaza on 26 March 1917 , while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on 19 April . A third assault occurred between 31 October and 7 November and this time both the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division took part . The battle was a complete success for the British , over @-@ running the Gaza @-@ Beersheba line and capturing 12 @,@ 000 Turkish soldiers . The critical moment was the capture of Beersheba on the first day , after the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade charged more than 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) . The Turkish trenches were overrun , with the Australians capturing the wells at <unk> and securing the valuable water they contained along with over 700 prisoners for the loss of 31 killed and 36 wounded . Later , Australian troops assisted in pushing the Turkish forces out of Palestine and took part in actions at <unk> Ridge , Jerusalem and the <unk> . The Turkish government surrendered on 30 October 1918 . Units of the Light Horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in Egypt in 1919 and did so with efficiency and brutality , although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process . 
 Meanwhile , the AFC had undergone remarkable development , and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the <unk> . <unk> just a single aircraft to German New Guinea in 1914 , the first operational flight did not occur until 27 May 1915 however , when the <unk> Half Flight was called upon to assist in protecting British oil interests in Iraq . The AFC was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in Egypt , Palestine and on the Western Front , where they performed well . 
 
 = = = Western Front = = = 
 
 Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action in France and Belgium , leaving Egypt in March 1916 . I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of <unk> on 7 April 1916 and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front , earning a formidable reputation . Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme , within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed . The 5th Division , positioned on the left flank , was the first in action during the Battle of <unk> on 19 July 1916 , suffering 5 @,@ 533 casualties in a single day . The 1st Division entered the line on 23 July , assaulting <unk> , and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July , they had suffered 5 @,@ 286 casualties . Mouquet Farm was attacked in August , with casualties totalling 6 @,@ 300 men . By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to re @-@ organise , they had suffered 23 @,@ 000 casualties in just 45 days . 
 In March 1917 , the 2nd and 5th Divisions pursued the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line , capturing the town of <unk> . On 11 April , the 4th Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of <unk> , losing over 3 @,@ 000 casualties and 1 @,@ 170 captured . On 15 April , the 1st and 2nd Divisions were counter @-@ attacked near <unk> and were forced to abandon the town , before <unk> it again . The 2nd Division then took part in the Second Battle of <unk> , beginning on 3 May , and succeeded in taking sections of the Hindenburg Line and holding them until relieved by the 1st Division . Finally , on 7 May the 5th Division relieved the 1st , remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid @-@ May . Combined these efforts cost 7 @,@ <unk> Australian casualties . 
 On 7 June 1917 , the II Anzac Corps — along with two British corps — launched an operation in Flanders to eliminate a salient south of Ypres . The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds ( 454 @,@ 545 kg ) of explosives that had been placed underneath the <unk> ridge , destroying the German trenches . The advance was virtually unopposed , and despite strong German counterattacks the next day , it succeeded . Australian casualties during the Battle of <unk> included nearly 6 @,@ 800 men . I Anzac Corps then took part in the Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the <unk> Plateau , between September and November 1917 . Individual actions took place at <unk> Road , <unk> Wood , <unk> , <unk> and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the Australians suffered 38 @,@ 000 casualties . 
 On 21 March 1918 the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in a last @-@ <unk> effort to win the war , <unk> sixty @-@ three divisions over a 70 miles ( 110 km ) front . As the Allies fell back the 3rd and 4th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme . The offensive lasted for the next five months and all five AIF divisions in France were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide . By late May the Germans had pushed to within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of Paris . During this time the Australians fought at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> Wood , <unk> , and Hamel . At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps , Lieutenant General John Monash , successfully used combined arms — including aircraft , artillery and armour — in an attack for the first time . 
 The German offensive ground to a halt in mid @-@ July and a brief lull followed , during which the Australians undertook a series of raids , known as <unk> <unk> . The Allies soon launched their own offensive — the Hundred Days Offensive — ultimately ending the war . Beginning on 8 August 1918 the offensive included four Australian divisions striking at Amiens . Using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel , significant gains were made on what became known as the "" Black Day "" of the German Army . The offensive continued for four months , and during Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Mont St Quentin , before their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at <unk> . The AIF was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 . 
 In all <unk> @,@ <unk> Australians enlisted in the AIF during the war and 333 @,@ 000 served overseas . 61 @,@ 508 were killed and another 155 @,@ 000 were wounded ( a total casualty rate of 65 % ) . The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £ <unk> @,@ <unk> @,@ <unk> . Two <unk> on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force , but stretching the reserves of manpower available , particularly towards the end of the fighting . Consequently , Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war . 
 The war had a profound effect on Australian society in other ways also . Indeed , for many Australians the nation 's involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor , while many of the notions of Australian character and <unk> that exist today have their origins in the war . 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War .

 The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the <unk> party assumed power in October 1917 . Following the end of the First World War , the western powers — including Britain — intervened , giving half @-@ hearted support to the pro @-@ <unk> , anti @-@ <unk> White Russian forces . Although the Australian government refused to commit forces , many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting . A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the North Russian Expeditionary Force ( <unk> ) . <unk> repatriation in England , about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force ( <unk> ) , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed . 
 The Royal Australian Navy destroyer <unk> Swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea in late 1918 . Other Australians served as advisers with the British Military Mission to the White Russian General , Anton <unk> in South Russia , while several more advised Admiral <unk> <unk> in Siberia . Later , they also served in Mesopotamia as part of <unk> and the <unk> Mission , although these missions were aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India , and did little fighting . 
 Although the motivations of those Australian 's that volunteered to fight in Russia can only be guessed at , it seems unlikely to have been political . Regardless , they confirmed a reputation for <unk> and courage , winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign , despite their small numbers . Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war . Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded , with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia .

Arriving at <unk> on 14 October , the ship proceeded to <unk> to protect the landing of three platoons of troops , then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the <unk> . The ship 's personnel took no part in operations ashore , providing only logistic and communications support . Adelaide returned to Australia on 23 November .

 A small number of Australian volunteers fought on both sides of the Spanish Civil War , although they predominantly supported the Spanish Republic through the International Brigades . The Australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other <unk> , such as the British Battalion and the Lincoln Battalion , rather than forming their own units . Most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons , while a number were Spanish @-@ born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin . At least 66 Australians volunteered , with only one — <unk> Bull , a conservative <unk> who was later killed serving in the RAF during the Second World War — known to have fought for General Francisco Franco 's Nationalist forces . 
 While a celebrated cause for the Australian left — particularly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement — the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality . Australian opposition to the Republican cause was <unk> by <unk> <unk> on an anti @-@ communist basis , rather than a pro @-@ Nationalist basis . <unk> , although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels , they received no public support . Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time , however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist , no action was taken . Consequently , returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the <unk> and Services League of Australia ( <unk> ) . Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least 14 were killed .

 Australia entered the Second World War on 3 September 1939 . At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and <unk> for war . <unk> for a Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) began in mid @-@ September . While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War , a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid @-@ 1940 . Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940 , three of which were dispatched to the Middle East . The RAAF 's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme ( <unk> ) , through which almost 28 @,@ 000 Australians were trained during the war . 
 The Australian military 's first major engagements of the war were against Italian forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa . During 1940 the light cruiser <unk> Sydney and five elderly destroyers ( dubbed the "" <unk> Iron Flotilla "" by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels — a title proudly accepted by the ships ) took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean Fleet , and sank several Italian warships . The Army first saw action in January 1941 , when the 6th Division formed part of the Commonwealth forces during Operation <unk> . The division assaulted and captured <unk> on 5 January and <unk> on 22 January , with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns . The 6th Division took part in the pursuit of the Italian Army and captured <unk> on 4 February . In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece , and was replaced by the 9th Division . 
 The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941 . During April , the 6th Division , other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece . At the end of this campaign , the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete . The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May , which also ended in defeat for the Allies . Over 5 @,@ 000 Australians were captured in these campaigns , and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat . The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt . The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were besieged at <unk> ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October . During June , the main body of the 7th Division , a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria @-@ Lebanon Campaign against the <unk> French . Resistance was stronger than expected ; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French <unk> in early July . 
 The majority of Australian units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early 1942 , after the outbreak of the Pacific War . The 9th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East , and played a key role in the First Battle of El <unk> during June and the Second Battle of El <unk> in October . The division returned to Australia in early 1943 , but several RAAF squadrons and <unk> warships took part in the subsequent Tunisia Campaign and the Italian Campaign from 1943 until the end of the war . 
 The RAAF 's role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed Australia 's main contribution to the defeat of Germany . Approximately 13 @,@ 000 Australian airmen served in dozens of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF <unk> Command between 1940 and the end of the war . Australians took part in all of <unk> Command 's major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France . Australian aircrew in <unk> Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost 20 percent of all Australian deaths in combat ; 3 @,@ 486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner . Australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945 and two RAAF maritime patrol squadrons served in the Battle of the Atlantic . 
 
 = = = Asia and the Pacific = = = 
 
 From the 1920s Australia 's defence thinking was dominated by British Imperial defence policy , which was embodied by the "" Singapore strategy "" . This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to Japanese aggression in the region . To this end , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased . However , as a result of the emphasis on co @-@ operation with Britain , relatively few Australian military units had been retained in Australia and the Asia @-@ Pacific region . Measures were taken to improve Australia 's defences as war with Japan <unk> in 1941 , but these proved inadequate . In December 1941 , the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division , most of which was stationed in Malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia . The RAAF was equipped with 373 aircraft , most of which were obsolete trainers , and the <unk> had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters . 
 The Australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the Pacific War . The 8th Division and RAAF squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the British Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller Japanese invasion force which landed on 7 December . The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singapore at the end of January , but was forced to surrender on 15 February after the Japanese captured much of the island . Smaller Australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early 1942 at Rabaul , and in Ambon , Timor , and Java . The Australian town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the Japanese on 19 February , to prevent it from being used as an Allied base . Over 22 @,@ 000 Australians were taken prisoner in early 1942 and endured harsh conditions in Japanese captivity . The prisoners were subjected to <unk> , denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards . As a result , 8 @,@ 296 Australian prisoners died in captivity . 
 The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the Japanese would invade the Australian mainland . While elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy proposed this in early 1942 , it was judged to be impossible by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters , which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa , and New Caledonia . This fact was not known by the Allies at the time , and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion . Large numbers of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early 1942 , and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March . 
 Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943 . After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay . Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the <unk> Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and USAAF . Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard @-@ fought Battle of <unk> @-@ <unk> . The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of <unk> in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the <unk> @-@ Lae campaign in April . In late 1943 , the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation <unk> , when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the <unk> Peninsula during the <unk> Peninsula campaign and <unk> Range campaign . 
 The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943 . Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943 . These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea , but were unsuccessful . Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies ( <unk> ) . 
 Australia 's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944 . The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production . Nevertheless , the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active , and agreed to MacArthur 's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns . In late 1944 , Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea , New Britain , and <unk> , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there . In May 1945 , I Corps , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign , which continued until the end of the war . These campaigns contributed little to Japan 's defeat and remain controversial . 
 Following Japan 's surrender on 15 August 1945 Australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored . Australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of Japanese personnel . <unk> @,@ 000 Australians enlisted during the war , while <unk> @,@ 000 served overseas . Casualties included 39 @,@ 767 killed and another 66 @,@ <unk> were wounded . 20 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Australians .

 The <unk> of the Australian military following the end of the Second World War was completed in 1947 . Plans for post @-@ war defence arrangements were <unk> on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force . It was envisioned that the Royal Australian Navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers , two cruisers , six destroyers , 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserved . The Royal Australian Air Force would have a strength of 16 squadrons , including four manned by the Citizen Air Force . Meanwhile , in a significant departure from previous Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces , the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of 19 @,@ 000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support , serving alongside a part @-@ time force of 50 @,@ 000 men in the Citizen Military Forces . The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947 , while the <unk> was re @-@ raised on 1 July 1948 .

 In the immediate post @-@ war period Australia contributed significant forces to the Allied occupation of Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( <unk> ) , which included forces from Australia , Britain , India and New Zealand . At its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade , four warships and three fighter squadrons , totalling 13 @,@ 500 personnel . The Australian Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in February 1946 and was based in <unk> Prefecture . The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949 , and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948 , forming the basis of the post @-@ war Regular Army . From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under @-@ strength battalion . Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the <unk> ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean <unk> following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 . The RAAF component consisted of Nos. 76 , 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P @-@ 51 Mustangs , initially based at <unk> from March 1946 , before transferring to <unk> in 1948 . However , by 1950 only No. 77 Squadron remained in Japan . A total of ten <unk> warships served in Japan during this period , including <unk> Ships Australia , Hobart , Shropshire , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Murchison , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , while <unk> Ships <unk> , <unk> and <unk> also provided support .

 During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin <unk> in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and <unk> . 
 
 = = = Korean War , 1950 – 53 = = = 
 
 On 25 June 1950 , the North Korean Army ( KPA ) crossed the border into South Korea and advanced for the capital Seoul , which fell in less than a week . North Korean forces continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later the United States offered its assistance to South Korea . In response the United Nations Security Council requested members to assist in <unk> the North Korean attack . Australia initially contributed P @-@ 51 Mustang fighter @-@ bomber aircraft from No. 77 Squadron RAAF and infantry from the 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 3 RAR ) , both of which were stationed in Japan as part of the <unk> . In addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea . The <unk> frigate <unk> <unk> , and the destroyer <unk> <unk> , were also committed . Later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard <unk> Sydney was added to the force . 
 By the time 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September , the North Koreans were in retreat following the <unk> landings . As a part of the invasion force under the UN Supreme Commander , General Douglas MacArthur , the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at Battle of <unk> near <unk> on 22 October , before advancing towards the <unk> River . Further successful actions followed at <unk> on 25 – 26 October 1950 and at <unk> on 29 October 1950 . North Korean casualties were heavy , while Australian losses included their commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November . Meanwhile , during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the People 's Volunteer Army across the <unk> River to reinforce the remnants of the KPA . <unk> by US and South Korean intelligence , the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) into North Korea , and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th Army Group ; in total 30 divisions composed of 380 @,@ 000 men . 3 RAR fought its first action against the Chinese at <unk> on 5 November . The fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a Chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake . Following the Chinese intervention , the UN forces were defeated in successive battles and 3 RAR was forced to withdraw to the 38th parallel . 
 A series of battles followed at <unk> on 1 – 4 January 1951 , as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the South Korean capital . Further fighting occurred at <unk> @-@ <unk> on 14 – 17 February 1951 following another Chinese advance , and later at <unk> @-@ San between 7 – 12 March 1951 as the UN resumed the offensive . Australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in 1951 , with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the Battle of <unk> . On 22 April , Chinese forces attacked the <unk> valley and forced the South Korean defenders to withdraw . Australian and Canadian troops were ordered to halt this Chinese advance . After a night of fighting the Australians recaptured their positions , at the cost of 32 men killed and 59 wounded . In July 1951 , the Australian battalion became part of the combined Canadian , British , Australian , New Zealand , and Indian 1st Commonwealth Division . The second major battle took place during Operation Commando and occurred after the Chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the Imjin River . The 1st Commonwealth Division counter @-@ attacked on 3 October , capturing a number of objectives including Hill 355 and Hill 317 during the Battle of Maryang San ; after five days the Chinese retreated . Australian casualties included 20 dead and 104 wounded . 
 The <unk> then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and <unk> forts behind barbed wire defences . From 1951 until the end of the war , 3 RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the division 's positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River . Across from them were heavily fortified Chinese positions . In March 1952 , Australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions , sending 1 RAR . This battalion remained in Korea for 12 months , before being replaced by 2 RAR in April 1953 . The Australians fought their last battle during 24 – 26 July 1953 , with 2 RAR holding off a <unk> Chinese attack along the <unk> River and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded . <unk> were suspended on 27 July 1953 . 17 @,@ 808 Australians served during the war , with 341 killed , 1 @,@ 216 wounded and 30 captured . 
 
 = = = Malayan Emergency , 1950 – 60 = = = 
 
 The Malayan Emergency was declared on 18 June 1948 , after three estate managers were murdered by members of the Malayan Communist Party ( <unk> ) . Australian involvement began in June 1950 , when in response to a British request , six <unk> from No. 1 Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force ( <unk> ) . The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as <unk> and <unk> drops , while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist ( CT ) jungle bases . The RAAF were particularly successful , and in one such mission known as Operation <unk> , five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps , killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender , in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops . The <unk> were withdrawn in 1958 , and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. 78 Wing . Based at RAAF Base <unk> they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas . 
 Australian ground forces were deployed to Malaya in October 1955 as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve . In January 1956 , the first Australian ground forces were deployed on Malaysian peninsula , consisting of the 2nd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 2 RAR ) . 2 RAR mainly participated in "" <unk> up "" operations over the next 20 months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the CT jungle bases , as part of 28th British Commonwealth Brigade . Contact with the enemy was <unk> and results small , achieving relatively few kills . 2 RAR left Malaysia October 1957 to be replaced by 3 RAR . 3 RAR underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving <unk> insurgents back into the jungle of <unk> and <unk> . The new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes . Again contact was limited , although 3 RAR had more success than its predecessor . By late 1959 , operations against the <unk> were in their final phase , and most communists had been pushed back and across the Thailand border . 3 RAR left Malaysia October 1959 and was replaced by 1 RAR . Though patrolling the border 1 RAR did not make contact with the insurgents , and in October 1960 it was replaced by 2 RAR , which stayed in Malaysia until August 1963 . The Malayan Emergency officially ended on 31 July 1960 . 
 Australia also provided artillery and engineer support , along with an air @-@ field construction squadron . The Royal Australian Navy also served in Malayan waters , firing on suspected communist positions between 1956 and 1957 . The Emergency was the longest continued commitment in Australian military history ; 7 @,@ 000 Australians served and 51 died in Malaya — although only 15 were on operations — and another 27 were wounded .

 At the start of the 1960s , Prime Minister Robert <unk> greatly expanded the Australian military so that it could carry out the Government 's policy of "" Forward Defence "" in South East Asia . In 1964 , <unk> announced a large increase in defence spending . The strength of the Australian Army would be increased by 50 % over three years from 22 @,@ 000 to 33 @,@ 000 ; providing a full three @-@ brigade division with nine battalions . The RAAF and <unk> would also both be increased by 25 % . In 1964 , conscription or National Service was re @-@ introduced under the National Service Act , for selected 20 @-@ year @-@ olds based on date of birth , for a period of two years ' continuous full @-@ time service ( the previous scheme having been suspended in 1959 ) . 
 In 1961 , three Charles F. Adams @-@ class destroyers were purchased from the United States to replace the ageing Q @-@ class destroyers . Traditionally , the <unk> had purchased designs based on those of the Royal Navy and the purchase of American destroyers was significant . <unk> Perth and <unk> Hobart joined the fleet in 1965 , followed by <unk> Brisbane in 1967 . Other projects included the construction of six River @-@ class frigates , the conversion of the aircraft carrier <unk> Melbourne to an anti @-@ submarine role , the acquisition of ten Wessex helicopters , and the purchase of six Oberon @-@ class submarines . 
 The RAAF took delivery of their first <unk> fighters in 1967 , <unk> No. 3 , No. 75 and No. 77 Squadrons with them . The service also received American F @-@ 111 strike aircraft , C @-@ 130 <unk> transports , P @-@ 3 Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and Italian <unk> trainers . 
 
 = = = Indonesia @-@ Malaysia <unk> , 1962 – 66 = = = 
 
 The Indonesia @-@ Malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia , with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state . The war remained limited , and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo , although a number of Indonesian <unk> and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur . As part of Australia 's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia , army , naval and <unk> units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve . Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only . On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help <unk> up <unk> from <unk> and airborne incursions at <unk> and <unk> , in September and October 1964 . 
 Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo . During the early phases , British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian / Indonesian border , and to protect population centres . However , by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action , crossing the border into <unk> to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the <unk> to remain on the defensive , under the <unk> Operation <unk> . The fighting took place in mountainous , jungle @-@ clad terrain , and a debilitating climate , with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border , cross @-@ border operations , the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply , and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions . 
 3 RAR deployed to Borneo in March 1965 , and served in <unk> until the end of July , operating on both sides of the border . The battalion had four major contacts with Indonesian forces and several smaller ones — including at Sungei <unk> , <unk> and <unk> during which they inflicted heavy casualties on the <unk> — as well as suffering casualties in two mine incidents . 4 RAR served a less @-@ eventful tour between April and August 1966 , and also operated over the border , successfully <unk> with the <unk> on a number of occasions . A squadron of the Special Air Service Regiment ( <unk> ) was also deployed in 1965 and again in 1966 , taking part in cross @-@ border operations and inflicting significant casualties on the <unk> , even though they were often tasked with covert reconnaissance . Other units included artillery and engineers , while a number of <unk> ships were involved in shelling Indonesian positions in Borneo and in <unk> <unk> in the Singapore Strait . The RAAF played a relatively minor role , although it would have been used far more extensively had the war escalated . 
 Operations in Borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia , while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross @-@ border missions only occurred in 1996 . Following a military coup in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General <unk> to power , a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict . 3 @,@ 500 Australians served during <unk> ; casualties included 16 dead , with seven killed in action and eight wounded . 
 
 = = = Vietnam War , 1962 – 73 = = = 
 
 Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War was driven largely by the rise of communism in Southeast Asia after the Second World War , and the fear of its spread which developed in Australia during the 1950s and early 1960s . As a consequence , Australia supported South Vietnam throughout the early 1960s . In 1961 and 1962 , the leader of the South Vietnamese government , <unk> <unk> <unk> , asked for assistance from the US and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist North Vietnam . Australia offered 30 military advisors from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam , which became known simply as "" The Team "" . They arrived in July and August 1962 , beginning Australia 's involvement in the war . Later in August 1964 , the RAAF sent a flight of <unk> transport aircraft to the port city of <unk> <unk> . 
 However , with the security situation in South Vietnam continuing to deteriorate , the US increased its involvement to 200 @,@ 000 combat troops by early 1965 . Australia also committed ground forces , dispatching the 1 RAR to serve with the US <unk> Airborne Brigade in <unk> <unk> province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought a number of significant actions , including Gang <unk> , Operation <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . In March 1966 , the Australian government announced the deployment of a brigade @-@ sized unit — the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 <unk> ) — to replace 1 RAR . Included were a large number of conscripts , under the increasingly controversial National Service Scheme . <unk> of two infantry battalions as well as armour , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at <unk> <unk> , in <unk> Tuy Province . Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No. 9 Squadron RAAF . At the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 , D Company , 6 RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a Viet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself . 18 Australians were killed and 24 wounded , while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield . The battle allowed the Australians to gain dominance over <unk> Tuy Province and 1 <unk> was not fundamentally challenged again . Regardless , during February 1967 the Australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point , losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week , the bulk during Operation <unk> . 
 Yet with the <unk> Tuy province coming progressively under control throughout 1967 , the Australians increasingly spent a significant period of time conducting operations further afield . 1 <unk> was subsequently deployed <unk> infiltration routes leading to Saigon to <unk> communist movement against the capital as part of Operation <unk> during the 1968 <unk> Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral – <unk> in May and June 1968 . At Fire Support <unk> Coral and <unk> the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength for the first time in near conventional warfare , ultimately fighting their largest , most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war . During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded , while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count , 60 possibly killed , 7 wounded and 11 captured . Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969 , <unk> <unk> in late @-@ December 1968 and early 1969 and Long <unk> in June 1971 . At the height of the Australian commitment , 1 <unk> numbered 8 @,@ 500 troops , including three infantry battalions , armour , artillery , engineers , logistics and aviation units in support . A third RAAF unit , No. 2 Squadron RAAF , flying Canberra bombers , was sent in 1967 , and four <unk> destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam . 
 The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November 1970 . As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty . 1 <unk> was again reduced to just two infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining . Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal , and 1 <unk> ceased operations in October . Meanwhile , the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of <unk> <unk> . The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973 . The Vietnam War was Australia 's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation 's military involvement increased a vocal anti @-@ war movement developed . More than 50 @,@ 000 Australians served in Vietnam ; <unk> were killed and 2 @,@ 398 were wounded . Four were awarded the Victoria Cross .

 Although the importance of ' joint ' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval , ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands , the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co @-@ ordination between the services in the post @-@ war era , with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine . The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military 's experiences in the Vietnam War . In 1973 , the Secretary of the Department of Defence , Arthur <unk> , submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff . 
 The <unk> Labor Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence <unk> ( Defence , Navy , Army , Air Force , and Supply ) into a single Department of Defence in 1973 , while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished . On 1 January 1976 , the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified , all @-@ volunteer , professional force known as the Australian Defence Force ( <unk> ) . Today , the <unk> is headquartered at Russell <unk> in Canberra and is divided into Air , Land , Maritime and Special Operations <unk> . In addition , Northern Command is based in Darwin , and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia . 
 
 = = = Defence of Australia , 1980s and 1990s = = = 
 
 Until the 1970s , Australia 's military strategy centred on the concept of Forward Defence , in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co @-@ operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia 's region . Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the United States in 1969 , and the British withdrawal ' east of Suez ' in the early 1970s , Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self @-@ reliance and the defence of the Australian continent . Known as the Defence of Australia Policy , it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation 's northern maritime approaches ( the ' air @-@ sea gap ' ) against possible attack . 
 In line with this goal , the <unk> was <unk> to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia . This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the <unk> and RAAF , and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia . During this time the <unk> had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia . However , in 1987 the <unk> made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 <unk> coups d 'état . While broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for the <unk> to improve its capability to rapidly respond to <unk> events . 
 During this period Australia continued to retain forces in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence <unk> ( <unk> ) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces . However , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973 , and the two <unk> fighter squadrons in 1988 . Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as Rifle Company <unk> have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments of F / A @-@ 18 <unk> fighter aircraft . Australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War . <unk> and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region . Since then the <unk> have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway , conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean , Strait of <unk> and South China Sea . They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights . 
 
 = = = Gulf War , 1991 = = = 
 
 Australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War , deploying a naval task group of two warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team ; in total about 750 personnel . The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the <unk> and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure . However , the Australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait . Some <unk> personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions . Following the war , the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq . A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no @-@ fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003 . 
 
 = = = Global security , late @-@ 1990s = = = 
 
 Since the late 1980s , the Australian government had increasingly called upon the <unk> to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world . While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists , several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel . Large peacekeeping deployments were made to <unk> in early 1989 , Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 , Somalia in 1993 , <unk> between 1994 and 1995 and <unk> in 1994 and from 1997 onwards . The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the <unk> 's force structure and role , with the new government 's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co @-@ operation with regional states and Australia 's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia 's global security interests . In line with this new focus , the <unk> 's force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the <unk> 's combat effectiveness .

 The former @-@ Portuguese colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 , however , following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President <unk> <unk> subsequently agreed to allow the East <unk> to vote on autonomy in 1999 . The United Nations Mission in East Timor ( <unk> ) was established to organise and conduct the vote , which was held at the end of August 1999 and resulted with 78 @.@ 5 % of voters deciding in favour of independence . However , following the announcement of the results pro @-@ Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military , launched a campaign of violence , looting and <unk> and many East <unk> were killed , while perhaps more than 500 @,@ 000 were displaced . Unable to control the violence , Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force . Australia , which had contributed police to <unk> , organised and led an international military coalition , known as the International Force for East Timor ( <unk> ) , a non @-@ UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions . The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5 @,@ 500 personnel , and included a significant ground force , supported by air and naval forces , in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945 . 
 Under the overall command of Australian Major General Peter <unk> , <unk> began arriving on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security , protecting and supporting <unk> , and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations . With the withdrawal of the Indonesian armed forces , police and government officials from East Timor , <unk> re @-@ established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September . On 19 October 1999 , Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force , the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( <unk> ) was established , becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence . The hand @-@ over of command of military operations from <unk> to <unk> was completed on 28 February 2000 . Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1 @,@ 500 and 2 @,@ 000 personnel , as well as landing craft and <unk> helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission . During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro @-@ Indonesian militia and on a number of occasions Indonesian forces as well , especially along the border with West Timor . Significant actions occurred in <unk> , <unk> <unk> and at <unk> in October 1999 . However , with the security situation <unk> the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005 . Two Australians died from non @-@ battle related causes , while a number were wounded in action . 
 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the <unk> 's ability to conduct operations outside Australia . This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the <unk> 's ability to mount and sustain such operations . In response , the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the <unk> for overseas deployments . The Australian government committed to improve the <unk> 's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of <unk> units , expanding the <unk> to 57 @,@ 000 full @-@ time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3 % per year . 
 In May 2006 , 2 @,@ 000 <unk> personnel were again deployed to East Timor as part of Operation <unk> , following unrest between elements of the Timor <unk> Defence Force . Australian forces were involved in a number <unk> during this time , including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by <unk> <unk> at Same on 4 March 2007 . However , by early @-@ 2010 the security situation had been <unk> and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force .

 Shortly after the Islamist inspired terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001 , Australian forces were committed to the American @-@ led international coalition against terrorism . The <unk> 's most visible contribution — codenamed Operation <unk> — has been a special forces task group operating in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 and again from mid @-@ 2005 to fight against the <unk> . Over time the Australian commitment has grown , with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a Reconstruction Task Force from 2006 to provide security , reconstruction and to mentor and train the <unk> National Army . Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP @-@ <unk> Orion surveillance aircraft and three C @-@ 130 <unk> transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since 2001 , supporting both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation <unk> . A detachment of four F / A @-@ 18 <unk> fighter @-@ bombers was based at Diego Garcia from late @-@ 2001 to mid @-@ 2002 , while two Boeing <unk> air @-@ to @-@ air <unk> aircraft were also based in Manas Air Base in <unk> to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in <unk> airspace but were later withdrawn . A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction <unk> in April 2007 . In addition to radar crews , logistics and intelligence officers , and security personnel , this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to 950 by mid @-@ 2007 , with further small increases to 1 @,@ 000 in mid @-@ 2008 , 1 @,@ 100 in early 2009 and 1 @,@ 550 in mid @-@ 2009 . 
 A modest force remained in Afghanistan over this time and was involved in counter @-@ insurgency operations in <unk> Province in conjunction United States and other coalition forces , including the Dutch prior to their withdrawal . The force consisted of motorised infantry , special forces , engineers , cavalry , artillery and aviation elements . By 2010 it included a combined arms battalion @-@ sized battle group known as the <unk> Task Force , and the Special Operations Task Group , both based at Forward Operation Base Ripley outside of <unk> <unk> , as well as the <unk> Wing Group flying CH @-@ <unk> <unk> , the Force <unk> <unk> and an RAAF air surveillance radar unit based in <unk> . In addition , a further 800 Australian logistic personnel were also based in the Middle East in support , but are located outside of Afghanistan . Meanwhile , <unk> of maritime patrol and transport aircraft continued to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan , based out of Al <unk> Air Base in the United Arab Emirates . Also included is the deployment of one of the <unk> 's frigates to the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden on counter piracy and maritime interdiction duties . 
 Australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting , and significant actions included Operation <unk> in 2002 and Operation Perth in 2006 , as well as actions in <unk> in 2007 , <unk> in 2009 , the Shah <unk> <unk> and <unk> in 2010 , and <unk> in 2011 ; although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements . Casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded , while another Australian also died serving with the British Army . Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia , the first such decorations in forty years . Following a <unk> in forces , the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 December 2013 ; however , approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers , and are stationed in <unk> and <unk> .

 Australian forces later joined British and American forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq . The initial contribution was also a modest one , consisting of just 2 @,@ <unk> personnel — codenamed Operation <unk> . Major force elements included special forces , <unk> and fixed wing aviation and naval units . Army units included elements from the <unk> and 4th Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( Commando ) , a CH @-@ 47 <unk> detachment and a number of other specialist units . <unk> units included the amphibious ship <unk> <unk> and the frigates <unk> Darwin and <unk> Anzac , while the RAAF deployed 14 F / A @-@ 18 Hornets from No. 75 Squadron , a number of AP @-@ <unk> <unk> and C @-@ 130 <unk> . The Australian Special Forces Task Force was one of the first coalition units forces to cross the border into Iraq , while for a few days , the closest ground troops to Baghdad were from the <unk> . During the invasion the RAAF also flew its first combat missions since the Vietnam War , with No. 75 Squadron flying a total of 350 sorties and dropping 122 laser @-@ guided bombs . 
 The Iraqi military quickly proved no match for coalition military power , and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn . While Australia did not initially take part in the post @-@ war occupation of Iraq , an Australian Army light armoured <unk> — designated the Al <unk> Task Group and including 40 <unk> light armoured vehicles and infantry — was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April 2005 as part of Operation <unk> . The role of this force was to protect the Japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units . The <unk> later became the <unk> Battle Group ( West ) ( <unk> ( W ) ) , following the hand back of Al <unk> province to Iraqi control . Force levels peaked at 1 @,@ 400 personnel in May 2007 including the <unk> ( W ) in Southern Iraq , the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team — Iraq . A <unk> frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf , while RAAF assets included C @-@ <unk> <unk> and AP @-@ <unk> elements . Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin <unk> the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid @-@ 2009 , while RAAF and <unk> operations were <unk> to other parts of the Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation <unk> . 
 Low @-@ level operations continued , however , with a small Australian force of 80 soldiers remaining in Iraq to protect the Australian Embassy in Baghdad as part of <unk> under Operation <unk> . <unk> was finally withdrawn in August 2011 , and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia 's diplomatic presence in Iraq . Although more than 17 @,@ 000 personnel served during operations in Iraq , Australian casualties were relatively light , with two soldiers accidentally killed , while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force .

 = Battle of the <unk> River = 
 
 The Battle of the <unk> River took place during the Second World War and involved Australian , New Zealand and Japanese forces . Part of the wider <unk> Campaign of the Pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the southern sector of <unk> Island . Coming after the Battle of <unk> 's Knoll in which a strong Japanese counterattack was defeated , the battle occurred in two distinct periods between 17 April and 22 May 1945 , as elements of the Australian 15th Brigade advanced south along the <unk> Road . 
 The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the <unk> River . Following the end of the early fighting , the Australian advance towards the main Japanese concentration at <unk> continued as they struck out towards the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective , <unk> away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies . As the Australian advance stalled , the Japanese began harassing the Australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late @-@ July and into August , the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards <unk> again . Ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began , bringing the campaign to an end .

 Japanese forces had landed on <unk> in early 1942 , capturing it from the small force of Australians <unk> the island . They had subsequently developed several <unk> on the island , using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States , Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area . These bases also helped protect Rabaul , the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea , and throughout 1943 , Allied planners determined that <unk> was vital for <unk> the Japanese base around Rabaul . 
 US Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape <unk> , on the western coast of the island , north of Empress Augusta Bay , in November 1943 . After an initial counter @-@ attack , the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around <unk> , establishing a strong perimeter . In March 1944 , the Japanese launched a heavy counter @-@ attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties . After this , the situation on <unk> became largely static , as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence , and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around <unk> . 
 In late 1944 , as part of plans to free US troops up for the Philippines campaign , the Australian II Corps — consisting of mainly Militia troops under the command of Lieutenant General Stanley <unk> — took over responsibility for Allied operations on <unk> from the American XIV Corps . Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December 1944 , initially establishing themselves around the US base at <unk> . Due to inaccurate intelligence , <unk> mistakenly believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17 @,@ 500 men , and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from <unk> in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere , rather than maintaining the defensive posture the US forces had adopted . However , Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of Japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40 @,@ 000 . 
 The campaign that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives : in the north , it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow <unk> Peninsula and contained ; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east – west avenues of approach , as well as <unk> them protection against further counter @-@ attacks , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main campaign in the south , where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around <unk> . 
 
 = = = Preliminary moves = = = 
 
 Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December 1944 , the Australian 7th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards <unk> . In late March and early April 1945 , they had fought the Battle of <unk> 's Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines . Meanwhile , the survivors of the Japanese force , heavily demoralised by their defeat , withdrew towards the <unk> River . The Australian 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the <unk> River , while the <unk> was also included as an "" intermediate objective "" . Japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the Australians at about 10 @,@ 500 men , of which 2 @,@ 300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd Division . The 15th Brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the Australian units on <unk> at the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th Brigade , which was in need of rest . 
 Under the command of Brigadier <unk> <unk> the 15th Brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , engineers from the 15th Field Company , a battery of 155 @-@ mm guns from ' U ' Heavy Battery , field artillery from the 2nd Field Regiment , and a number of smaller support units . The <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion took over responsibility for <unk> 's Knoll replacing the 25th Infantry Battalion while the 24th Infantry Battalion took up a position across the <unk> Road . The brigade 's third battalion — the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion — did not join them until the beginning of May , and so the 7th Brigade 's 9th Infantry Battalion continued patrolling operations north of the <unk> River , in the <unk> area , until the 57th / 60th could dispatch elements to relieve them . Further inland , the 2 / 8th Commando Squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south @-@ east , defending the brigade 's left , or eastern , flank . 
 The Japanese forces opposing the Australians belonged to the 6th Division , under the command of Lieutenant General <unk> <unk> . <unk> had been ordered to delay the Australian advance between the <unk> and the <unk> for as long as possible , and with these orders in mind he had installed a number of strong points along the Australian 's expected line of advance . The division 's infantry had suffered heavily in the previous battle around <unk> 's Knoll and as a consequence , several units had to be reorganized or amalgamated . The front line positions were assigned to the 6th Field Artillery Regiment , while the 13th Infantry Regiment was to hold five <unk> to their rear along and <unk> the <unk> Road , designated ' A ' through to ' E ' . The 6th Field and 4th Field Heavy Artillery Regiments both held <unk> further back , designated ' F ' and ' G ' . The 23rd Infantry Regiment was placed in the rear , where it was being reconstituted following losses suffered during the attack on <unk> 's Knoll .

 The 15th Brigade took over the forward positions from the 7th Brigade on 17 April . Initial <unk> had the 24th Infantry Battalion on the <unk> Road around <unk> Creek , with the <unk> / 59th around <unk> , north @-@ east of <unk> 's Knoll , and the 57th / 60th , when it arrived to relieve the 9th , would be positioned further east <unk> a secondary , parallel track known to the Australians as the Commando Road . Two days later , <unk> received the order to commence the advance towards the <unk> from <unk> , who offered him the support of the 29th Brigade as a mobile reserve in case of sudden counter @-@ attack . In a change to the tactics that the Australians had previously employed prior to the fighting around <unk> 's Knoll , from early May they advanced on a two @-@ battalion front , instead of one . The 24th Infantry Battalion was in the van , moving along the <unk> Road with the <unk> / 59th protecting its flank and rear ; while 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) further inland the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion , commencing on 3 May , advanced along the Commando Road from <unk> , after taking over from the 9th Infantry Battalion . 
 Moving forward under a <unk> barrage as they moved beyond <unk> , the 24th Infantry Battalion was the first to contact the Japanese , carrying out an attack against Japanese positions around <unk> 's Creek on 17 April . <unk> by a troop of Matilda tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells , two infantry companies — ' C ' and ' D ' — from the 24th attacked the position while another — ' A ' Company — carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards <unk> and <unk> . The left forward company — ' D ' Company — reached its objective without trouble ; however , ' C ' Company — on the right along with the troop of tanks — came up against stiff Japanese resistance and became bogged down . ' A ' Company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the <unk> track . In support of ' A ' Company , <unk> came forward and raked the jungle , hacking through the <unk> to reveal several Japanese <unk> , which were destroyed by the Australian armour . As night fell , ' C ' Company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning . Engineers were brought forward , as was a <unk> , and the gap was <unk> . <unk> heavy fighting , the Australians forced their way across the creek . By the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation 400 yd ( 370 m ) beyond the creek , 37 Japanese had been killed for the loss of seven Australians killed and 19 wounded . After this , the Australians continued their advance towards <unk> Creek , which was a further 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the southeast . In response , the Japanese launched a number of determined counterattacks over the course of the following week , although these were turned back . During this time , the Australians sent a number of patrols out in front of their forward elements , one of which managed to slip through the Japanese defensive positions either side of the <unk> Road and carried out a reconnaissance of the <unk> River about 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 910 m ) south of the main crossing . Further patrols were carried out , as well as a number of ambushes , before the advance was resumed on 26 April . 
 <unk> their advance , the Australians were supported by three squadrons of <unk> from the Royal New Zealand Air Force — Nos. 14 , 22 and 26 Squadrons — which bombed and <unk> the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a <unk> barrage of artillery and mortar fire . With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the <unk> , for just one man wounded . Further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices . After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . To <unk> the effectiveness of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support . Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire . 
 Meanwhile , the previous day , 3 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north . Here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed . They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on 6 May . On 5 May , along the <unk> Road , the 24th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again . <unk> with a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 Japanese . After the lead Matilda 's machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew . Moving around the stricken tank , the second Matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the Japanese defenders from the position . That night , the Japanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company @-@ sized counter @-@ attack . The fighting lasted for over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours , but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack . In doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking Japanese had suffered heavily , losing 58 men killed . It was the biggest loss since the action at <unk> 's Knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the <unk> . 
 After this , the Australians were able to resume their advance to the river on 7 May without further opposition . The previous three weeks in which they had advanced 7 @,@ 000 yd ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) to the <unk> had been costly for them , however , with the Australian 24th Infantry Battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded . Against this , the Japanese had lost at least 169 killed .

 Following the advance to the <unk> , there was a pause of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the <unk> en <unk> . This allowed <unk> to re @-@ evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . As they waited for the advance to resume , the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time . As a part of these , the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the <unk> and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as <unk> 's Ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main Australian axis of advance . 
 The main crossing was planned for 20 May , with the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the <unk> Road and the <unk> Track to the east of the river , while on the left the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line , crossing at the <unk> <unk> , advancing straight up the <unk> Road . Preliminary moves began before this , and on 15 May a platoon from the 24th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on <unk> 's Ridge . After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a Japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw . Meanwhile , the <unk> <unk> squadrons — now reinforced by No. 16 Squadron — began an eight @-@ day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the <unk> and Commando Roads . During this period , the New Zealanders flew 381 sorties , while artillery and mortars fired "" thousands of rounds "" . 
 Two days later , on 17 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank , crossing the <unk> inland and advancing along the Commando Road with 32 <unk> and two batteries of artillery in support . Crossing 500 yd ( 460 m ) north of the <unk> , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing . Nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on 20 May . 
 In the centre , the main attack along the <unk> Road began at 08 : 30 on 20 May after 20 minutes of <unk> by New Zealand <unk> had prepared the ground . <unk> under a <unk> barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve , along with two troops of Matilda tanks . <unk> the forward companies reached their objectives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig @-@ in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded . The attack was resumed the following day , and the Australians were able to advance to the <unk> <unk> ; however , they were prevented from moving any further as the Japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground . Finally , a company from the 24th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on <unk> 's Ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped . Engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature . 
 On the right flank , the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the <unk> by <unk> . Beginning their move two days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with the Japanese . Meanwhile , using <unk> to drag the tanks through the mud , the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 : 00 on 20 May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , <unk> to the Japanese . The following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance . Later , after one of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition . 
 By 22 May , although there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the Australian objectives had been secured and <unk> up operations began . The last remaining defensive location before the <unk> was <unk> 's Ridge , where the Japanese were sheltering in tunnels . A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge . It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry . Within a short period of time the <unk> Road was subsequently opened , providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Rivers . The final phase of the battle cost the Japanese 106 killed , while the Australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded . 
 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 
 During the course of the fighting around the <unk> , the Australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded , while the Japanese lost at least 275 men killed . Following the battle , the Australians continued their advance towards <unk> at the southern end of the island . Throughout the remainder of the month and into June , the 15th Brigade advanced along the <unk> Road , crossing the <unk> on 10 June . Beyond the river , the Japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep <unk> . These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th Brigade subsequently crossed <unk> River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson 's 29th Brigade in early July . 
 As the 29th Brigade advanced toward the <unk> River , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt . The height of the river rose 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . The <unk> Road was reduced , in the words of Gavin Long , "" to a sea of mud "" and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were washed away . This rendered large @-@ scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the <unk> ; meanwhile , the Japanese continued to harass the Australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the Australian line of communications . On 9 July , the 15th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around <unk> , at the junction of the <unk> River and the <unk> Road , which included a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment . Australian patrols were resumed in late July and continued into August . These attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding . 
 Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also , and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards <unk> continued into August , combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed . As a result , the final Australian operations on <unk> took place on the <unk> front in the northern sector , where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at <unk> <unk> had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the <unk> Peninsula . By mid @-@ August , however , following the dropping of two atomic bombs on <unk> and <unk> and Japan 's subsequent unconditional surrender , a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this , it spelt an end to major combat operations . 
 Following the end of the war , the Australian Army awarded three battle honours for the fighting around the <unk> River . The 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , and the 9th , 24th , 57th / 60th and <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalions received the battle honour "" <unk> River "" . A second battle honour — "" <unk> 's Ridge – <unk> Ford "" — was also awarded to the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , and the 24th and <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalions for the second stage of the fighting , while the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion received the separate battle honour of "" Commando Road "" for this period .

 "" The <unk> Blues "" is a blues song by American folk and blues musician , Lead <unk> . It was written in June 1937 in response to the discrimination and segregation that Lead <unk> faced during a visit to Washington , DC to record for Alan <unk> . It rails against racism , the Jim Crow laws , and the conditions of contemporary African Americans in the southern United States . 
 The song was recorded in December 1938 for the Library of Congress and re @-@ recorded in 1939 for commercial release . It has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including Pete Seeger , <unk> <unk> , Hans <unk> , and Billy Bragg . 
 "" The <unk> Blues "" is regarded as one of Lead <unk> 's best original works , but it also drew controversy . There is doubt over the song 's authorship , with some scholars <unk> that Lead <unk> was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator . <unk> have been raised over his role in the American Communist Party and whether he and the song were used to further the party 's political goals .

 Most music historians date the writing of "" The <unk> Blues "" to Lead <unk> 's June 1937 trip to Washington , DC , when he was invited by the <unk> Alan <unk> to record for the Library of Congress 's folk music collection . On the first night Lead <unk> and his wife Martha spent in the city , they encountered racially <unk> Jim Crow laws similar to those found in their native Louisiana : most hotels refused to rent rooms to African Americans and the few that would were either full or refused to serve him because he was with a white man ( <unk> ) . <unk> , in some versions of the story described as an unnamed "" white friend "" , offered to let the couple stay for the night in his apartment near the Supreme Court Building . The next morning , Lead <unk> <unk> to <unk> arguing with his <unk> about the presence of a black man , with the <unk> threatening to call the police . 
 While in Washington , Lead <unk> encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the <unk> of the song . For instance , when Lead <unk> , <unk> , and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together , they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them . Lead <unk> was told that if he returned later without <unk> , he would be served . 
 In response to one of these incidents , a friend of Lead <unk> 's , variously identified as either <unk> or Mary Elizabeth <unk> joked that Washington was a "" <unk> town . "" Though Lead <unk> did not know what the word "" <unk> "" meant , he was fascinated by the sound of it , and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip . The song came together quickly ; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead <unk> to write it . <unk> liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment .

 "" The <unk> Blues "" is a blues @-@ style protest song that criticizes the culture of Washington , DC . It protests against both the city 's Jim Crow laws and the racism of its white population . Its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to "" spread the news all around "" about the racial issues <unk> the city . The song , particularly in the refrain , <unk> race and economics by referring to <unk> as "" <unk> "" . 
 The first two verses speak of the segregation that Lead <unk> encountered in Washington DC : the first recounts the fact that during the trip , Lead <unk> was "" turned down "" wherever he tried to get served due to his race , while the second recounts the argument between <unk> and his <unk> over Lead <unk> staying in his apartment . The third verse <unk> cites "" the home of the brave , the land of the Free "" , juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in Washington , DC . The fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city , leading to the song 's end , which suggests that African Americans boycott buying homes in the district . 
 The song 's tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters ; despite this , by "" spreading the news "" of his poor treatment in a song , the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern African Americans and northern whites that the status <unk> is deeply flawed and that something needs to change . 
 "" The <unk> Blues "" follows a traditional twelve @-@ bar blues format . It is written in 44 time but <unk> to note that the song <unk> should swing at medium <unk> . The song was written in B ♭ . It uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating , followed by the final two verses and a <unk> .

 Lead <unk> first recorded "" The <unk> Blues "" in December 1938 in New York City , for donation to the Library of Congress . He re @-@ recorded the song in April 1939 for <unk> Records , for release the same year as a 78 rpm record . The version that was commercially released features Lead <unk> singing and playing the twelve @-@ string guitar without any other accompaniment . 
 The song has been covered and <unk> by a variety of artists including Pete Seeger and Hans <unk> . Seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums . In Australia , the song was reworked as "" Canberra Blues "" by The <unk> <unk> , an R & B band . The lyrics speak of the problems faced by young Australians in the Australian Capital Territory in the 1960s . <unk> adapted the song to his style of European blues for the album Journey On in 1997 . 
 In 2006 , Billy Bragg reworked the song as "" Bush War Blues "" . Bragg 's cover is a topical protest song about the Iraq War . In one verse , Bragg claims that the Iraq War was not for democracy but instead was to "" make the world safe for <unk> "" . In another , he takes on the Christian right , asking where the <unk> are . Finally , Bragg <unk> the United States government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war .

 "" The <unk> Blues "" is one of Lead <unk> 's most famous songs and is remembered as his most "" heartfelt protest song "" . There is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance . Robert <unk> claims that the song is "" peripheral "" to the wider study of the blues , while Lawson points to it as a watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of the United States . There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics . After its release , it became popular with left @-@ wing political groups . Lead <unk> was invited to perform at Camp Unity , the Communist Party USA 's summer retreat , and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s . This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform . The party claims , to the contrary , that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform . 
 Jeff Todd <unk> and several other writers have suggested that Lead <unk> had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song . This theory stems from the idea that Lead <unk> did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by <unk> . Since the music that <unk> recorded was sold to <unk> sympathetic to Civil Rights , it has been suggested that <unk> helped him write a song attractive to a white audience . Lead <unk> admitted that the term "" <unk> "" was unfamiliar to him , and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work .

 "" <unk> "" is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance <unk> ( 2005 ) . It was written and produced by Madonna and Stuart Price , and released as the second single from the album on February 7 , 2006 . It later appeared on Celebration , her 2009 greatest hits album . An uptempo dance song , "" <unk> "" was one of the first tracks developed for the album and had numerous remix treatments before the ultimate version of the track was finalized . One of the remixes was done by the Pet Shop Boys , featuring added lyrics by the band . The actual song features a dance groove tempo . It talks about personal <unk> and self @-@ <unk> . 
 "" <unk> "" received positive reviews from contemporary critics , who declared the track the strongest song on Confessions on a Dance <unk> . Some critics also commented on the song 's disco @-@ influenced beats while comparing it to Madonna 's older dance songs . It achieved commercial success , topping the singles charts in Italy , Spain , Romania and the United Kingdom , where it became Madonna 's twelfth number one single . Elsewhere , the song was a top ten hit . However , in the United States , the song did not perform well due to an <unk> on radio but was able to reach the top of Billboard 's dance charts and became one of the decade 's most successful dance hits . 
 The accompanying music video , directed by Madonna 's <unk> Jamie King , was a continuation from the "" <unk> Up "" music video . It featured Madonna and her dancers <unk> around a city in a van , dancing on roller <unk> and Madonna fighting with a group of men in a cage . She performed the song on her 2006 Confessions Tour in a similar fight sequence to that shown in the video .

 "" <unk> "" was one of the first tracks developed for Confessions on a Dance <unk> , along with "" <unk> Up "" and "" Future Lovers "" . It was also the one which took the most time to finish because Madonna "" thought it was too melodramatic and could never decide when it was right . "" The songs were developed with a remixed perspective in mind . Madonna commented that , "" Whenever I make records , I often like the remixes better than the original ones . [ ... ] So I thought , screw that . I 'm going to start from that perspective "" . She promoted the album at the dance party "" <unk> "" held at Luke & <unk> 's nightclub in Greenwich Village , invited by Junior <unk> to take over the DJ booth where she mixed "" <unk> Up "" with "" <unk> "" . Musically , "" <unk> "" is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and strong vocal on the chorus . It is set in common time with a moderately fast dance groove tempo of 132 beats per minute . <unk> in the key of C minor , Madonna 's vocal range spans from <unk> to <unk> . It follows the chord progression of E ♭ – <unk> – A ♭ – B ♭ during the spoken introduction . It then changes to <unk> – <unk> @-@ <unk> in the chorus , while continuing in A ♭ – <unk> – A ♭ – <unk> in the intermediate verses , ultimately ending in repeated lines of "" I 've heard it all before "" . 
 Lyrically the song has <unk> of different languages including French , Spanish , Italian , Dutch , Hebrew , Hindi , Polish and Japanese . The song talks about personal <unk> and self @-@ <unk> , denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like "" Everybody "" ( 1982 ) , "" Vogue "" ( 1990 ) or "" Music "" ( 2000 ) which was centered around the subject of music itself . Among the various remixes , the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston 's "" I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) "" with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction . Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other , from the time they wrote the song "" Heart "" ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it . The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album <unk> Four . Madonna 's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook . A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends , leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends .

 = Homarus gammarus = 
 
 Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of <unk> lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming "" lobster red "" on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into <unk> larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles . 
 
 = = Description = = 
 
 Homarus gammarus is a large <unk> , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard <unk> which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called <unk> ( <unk> ) . This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals . 
 The first pair of <unk> is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the "" <unk> "" , and has rounded <unk> used for crushing prey ; the other is the "" cutter "" , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the <unk> , and the right is the cutter . 
 The <unk> is generally blue above , with spots that <unk> , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment <unk> is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . 
 The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : 
 The <unk> of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H. gammarus . 
 The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped . 
 The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red , while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red . 
 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 
 Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently <unk> female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her <unk> . Females carrying eggs are said to be "" <unk> "" and can be found throughout the year . 
 The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on <unk> . This stage involves three <unk> and lasts for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a <unk> lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the <unk> phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives . 
 
 = = Distribution = = 
 
 Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The <unk> populations are found in the Norwegian <unk> <unk> and <unk> , inside the Arctic Circle . 
 The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the "" midnight @-@ sun lobster "" . The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel . 
 Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer <unk> . Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from <unk> in <unk> , but the species did not become established there . 
 
 = = Ecology = = 
 
 Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – <unk> ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . 
 The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other <unk> invertebrates . These include crabs , molluscs , sea <unk> , <unk> and polychaete worms . 
 The three <unk> lobster species Homarus gammarus , H. americanus and <unk> <unk> are hosts to the three known species of the animal <unk> <unk> ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described . 
 Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> , caused by the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out . 
 
 = = Human consumption = = 
 
 Homarus gammarus is traditionally "" highly esteemed "" as a <unk> and was mentioned in "" The <unk> "" a seventeenth century English folk song . It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain "" excellent "" white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the <unk> mill and the "" sand vein "" ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour . 
 <unk> are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines <unk> with <unk> or <unk> sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) . The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) . 
 <unk> systems for H. gammarus are under development , and production rates are still very low . 
 
 = = <unk> history = = 
 
 Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema <unk> , published in 1758 . That name was Cancer gammarus , since Linnaeus ' concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans . 
 H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary <unk> , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 . 
 The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a <unk> selected by <unk> <unk> in 1974 . It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near <unk> , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the <unk> have since been lost . 
 The common name for H. gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is "" European lobster "" , but the species is also widely known as the "" common lobster "" .

 Tim Richmond ( June 7 , 1955 – August 13 , 1989 ) was an American race car driver from <unk> , Ohio . He competed in <unk> racing before transferring to <unk> 's Winston Cup Series ( now <unk> Cup Series ) . Richmond was one of the first drivers to change from open wheel racing to <unk> stock cars full @-@ time , which has since become an industry trend . He won the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award and had 13 victories during eight <unk> seasons . 
 Richmond achieved his top <unk> season in 1986 when he finished third in points . He won seven races that season , more than any other driver on the tour . When he missed the season @-@ opening <unk> 500 in February 1987 , media reported that he had pneumonia . The infection most likely resulted from his compromised immune system , which was weakened by AIDS . Despite the state of his health , Richmond competed in eight races in 1987 , winning two events and one pole position before his final race in August of that year . He attempted a comeback in 1988 before <unk> I banned him for testing positive for excessive <unk> ( over the counter ) drugs , <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> later announced they gave Tim Richmond a new test and tested negative . Tim Richmond filed a lawsuit against <unk> after <unk> insisted they wanted access to his entire medical record before they would reinstate him , after losing the lawsuit , Richmond withdrew from racing . <unk> later stated their original test was a "" Bad Test . "" 
 Richmond grew up in a wealthy family and lived a <unk> lifestyle , earning him the nickname "" Hollywood "" . In describing Richmond 's influence in racing , Charlotte Motor <unk> president <unk> Wheeler said : "" We 've never had a race driver like Tim in stock car racing . He was almost a James Dean @-@ like character . "" When Richmond was cast for a bit part in the 1983 movie <unk> Ace , "" He fell right in with the group working on the film , "" said director Hal <unk> . Cole <unk> , the main character in the movie Days of Thunder , played by Tom Cruise , was loosely based on Richmond and his interaction with Harry Hyde and Rick <unk> .

 Richmond grew up in <unk> , Ohio . His parents , Al and Evelyn ( née Warner ) Richmond , met in the course of their work . Al was a <unk> for pipe construction companies and Evelyn was a field office manager . <unk> that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe , Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway . To market this invention , he founded Richmond Manufacturing , which eventually exported machines worldwide . 
 Tim 's driving days started as a <unk> when he was given a go @-@ <unk> that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn . He later raced the <unk> at tracks in <unk> and New <unk> . Richmond grew up in a well @-@ to @-@ do family , and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates , so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami , Florida . During his years in Miami , Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio . While home in Ohio over a summer break , he met local drag <unk> Raymond <unk> through lifelong friend Fred Miller . When Richmond reached age 16 , his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am , a <unk> and a Piper <unk> airplane for his birthday . Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about <unk> her only son . She once said , "" Tim was lazy ... "" , and "" ... I did everything for him . I ruined him , I admit it . He was my whole life . "" 
 Richmond excelled in sports ; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his <unk> days were over . Miami Military Academy named him <unk> of the Year in 1970 . Richmond 's other interests included flying , and he earned his private pilot license at age 16 . Following high school graduation , Richmond attended <unk> University for about one year before dropping out .

 A friend of Richmond 's father co @-@ owned a sprint car and Richmond joined the team as a crew member for Dave Shoemaker . In 1976 , 21 @-@ year @-@ old Richmond took the car onto <unk> <unk> at <unk> , Ohio for some practice laps . "" Somebody put a <unk> on me , "" Richmond said . "" I was running laps faster than Dave had been . It was the first time I had ever driven a race car . "" Richmond and his father found a red , white and blue @-@ colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania , which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child . In his first competition at the track , officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat . He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle . Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction , the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight . After being towed to the pits , he parked the car for the rest of the event . Later that season , they towed the car to <unk> <unk> , only to have Richmond crash the car again . In response , Richmond 's father fired him as the driver . The next season , Al Richmond bought a <unk> better suited to his son 's driving style . In 1977 Tim Richmond became both <unk> <unk> 's Rookie of the Year and the <unk> class track champion . 
 Richmond returned to racing sprint cars in the United States Automobile Club 's ( <unk> ) national sprint car tour in 1978 . <unk> in 12 races , he finished 30th in points as the series ' Rookie of the Year . That year he attended Jim Russell 's road racing school at <unk> Springs International <unk> Park , setting a student course record . Richmond raced in a 1978 Mini <unk> car event at Phoenix International <unk> , winning the Formula Super <unk> support event in a <unk> <unk> . The win attracted sponsors and attention from major owners like Roger <unk> . He also competed in <unk> 's Silver Crown series . 
 Richmond 's father bought an Eagle <unk> Car chassis and an <unk> engine for the 1979 race at Michigan International <unk> . Richmond qualified 21st fastest with a 175 @.@ <unk> mph ( <unk> @.@ <unk> km / h ) lap , significantly slower than Bobby <unk> 's 203 @.@ <unk> mph ( <unk> @.@ 111 km / h ) pole position speed .

Richmond raced in three more events that season . 
 After crashing during the first day of qualifying for the 1980 Indianapolis 500 , Richmond nevertheless obtained the 19th starting position in the race . He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race , led a lap , and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race . To the delight of the crowd , winner Johnny Rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits . He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year . "" I <unk> up a few <unk> cars right after that , "" he said . "" Milwaukee , Mid @-@ Ohio . . . at Michigan I cut one in two . I was afraid my racing career would come to a halt .

 Richmond raced for three teams in 1981 . He started the season by competing in 15 events for <unk> . He had his first career top 10 finish , taking sixth place at <unk> <unk> , soon followed by a seventh @-@ place finish at Texas World <unk> . After <unk> <unk> hired him away from <unk> mid @-@ season , Richmond had top 10 finishes at <unk> and Bristol . For the final seven races of the season , he drove for Bob Rogers and had a top 10 finish at Dover International <unk> . Overall for the season , Richmond had six top 10 finishes to place 16th in season points . 
 Richmond started 1982 without a ride before getting a one @-@ race deal to drive for Billie Harvey at the <unk> track . Richmond completed 112 laps of the <unk> @-@ lap event to finish 31st , retiring from the race with engine problems . For the following event , Richmond was hired to drive <unk> Stacy 's No. 2 car . In his first race for the team , Richmond earned his first career top 5 finish when he placed fifth at Darlington <unk> . Returning to <unk> , he finished second , before winning his first race on the road course at Riverside , California the following week . Later that season , he earned his first pole position at Bristol . The tour returned to Riverside for the final race of the season where Richmond won his second race , sweeping both events at the track . Benny Parsons said that "" watching Richmond go through the <unk> was unbelievable "" . For the season , Richmond had twelve top 10s , two wins , and one pole to finish 26th in points . 
 In 1983 , Richmond began racing for Raymond <unk> whom he had known before he started racing . He returned to the three @-@ cornered <unk> racetrack , earning his first oval victory . During the season , he accumulated four pole positions ( Darlington , <unk> , Charlotte , and Atlanta ) , one win ( <unk> ) , and fifteen top 10s on his way to finishing tenth in season points . He made his first appearance in a <unk> Busch Series ( now Nationwide Series ) car , but did not finish any of the three races he entered that season . 
 <unk> magazine named Richmond as one of "" the best of the new generation "" in 1984 . That year he had one win at North <unk> <unk> and second @-@ place finishes at Dover , Darlington and Riverside . Richmond finished the 1984 season 12th in points , with 11 finishes in the top 10 and in six in the top 5 . In 1985 , the final season that Richmond competed for <unk> , his best finish was a second @-@ place run at Bristol . He ended the season 11th in points with 13 Top 10s in 28 races .

 Richmond joined <unk> <unk> in 1986 , where he teamed up with veteran crew chief Harry Hyde . It took the team until the middle of the season to gel . Richmond had suffered a 64 @-@ race <unk> streak that was finally broken at the Van <unk> Diamond Mine 500 at <unk> in June 1986 . After two straight second @-@ place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside , Richmond started the <unk> event in third place inside the second row . That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point . <unk> wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official , so the <unk> body had the drivers slowly circle the track . It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps , and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their <unk> . Two hours later , the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third . After Richmond 's car was adjusted to remove the "" push "" , the car was more to his liking . Because his radio did not work , he was unable to communicate with his crew chief , Hyde , and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left . Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end . After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race , Dale <unk> made up three seconds on Richmond 's five @-@ second lead . With four laps to go , <unk> <unk> spun in a three @-@ car accident . The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the <unk> flag for the victory .

 Richmond fell ill the day after the 1986 <unk> annual banquet during a promotional trip to New York . He was not well enough to begin the 1987 <unk> season despite lengthy hospitalization in Cleveland and further rest at home ; when Richmond missed the <unk> 500 , his condition was reported as double pneumonia . Media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune <unk> syndrome ( AIDS ) . He returned to <unk> for the Miller High Life 500 during the middle of the year . Starting third , he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps , including the final 46 , to win the race by eight car @-@ lengths over Bill Elliott . In the middle of the race , Richmond 's car suffered <unk> problems . Because he could use only fourth ( high ) gear , he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits . Richmond was emotional after the victory , saying , "" I had tears in my eyes when I took the <unk> flag . Then every time anyone <unk> me , I started <unk> again . "" Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside , and made his final 1987 start at Michigan International <unk> 's Champion <unk> <unk> 400 that August , finishing 29th with a blown engine . He resigned from <unk> <unk> in September 1987 . 
 Although Richmond attempted a comeback in 1988 , <unk> suspended him for testing positive for banned substances .

 On August 13 , 1989 , Richmond died at the age of 34 , about two years after his final <unk> race . He was buried in <unk> , Ohio . 
 The secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days . At the time , Punch stated that Richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident , though it is unlikely that Richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months . Ten days after his death , on August 23 , the Richmond family held a press conference to reveal that Richmond died from complications from AIDS , which he acquired from an unknown woman . Richmond 's physician , Dr. David Dodson , said : "" There 's no way of knowing who that woman was . Tim was a celebrity with a lot of <unk> , a handsome guy . He naturally attracted a lot of women .

 The mountains are characteristic of the Great Basin 's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys . <unk> generally north to south , the <unk> Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt , which came from an ancient volcano and other <unk> , on top of older <unk> rocks . The southern end of the range , however , features many <unk> <unk> . As a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by <unk> and canyons . 
 Most of the range is public land administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management . There is very little human development in the remote region — cattle grazing and <unk> are the primary human uses — but former mines at the <unk> <unk> produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in North America in the 20th century . Public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited . <unk> includes large <unk> of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands . Sage grouse and mountain <unk> are two bird species native to the range , and common mammals include <unk> and jackrabbits . 
 Despite the area 's dry climate , a few year @-@ round streams provide habitat for the rare <unk> <unk> trout . Fish populations in the <unk> Creek Mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century . In the 1980s , the effects of grazing <unk> on riparian zones and the fish led to land @-@ use conflict . The <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group was formed in 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties . The <unk> met and agreed on changes to land @-@ use practices , and since the early 1990s , riparian zones have begun to recover .

 The range and surrounding non @-@ mountainous areas cover an area of <unk> square miles ( 2 @,@ 100 km2 ) . The mountains run 51 miles ( 82 km ) north to south and 36 miles ( 58 km ) east to west . More of the range is in Oregon ( 78 % ) than in Nevada ( 22 % ) . The highest point in the range is <unk> View <unk> , which is 8 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level and is located in Nevada about one mile south of the Oregon border . About two miles southeast of <unk> View is Disaster Peak , "" a large , symmetrical <unk> that is visible throughout the region . "" At 7 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 372 m ) , Disaster Peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub @-@ range called The <unk> . 
 The Oregon Canyon Mountains border the <unk> Creek Mountains on the east along the Harney – <unk> county line ( according to the United States Geological Survey 's definitions ) , while the <unk> Mountains are the next range west of the <unk> Creek Mountains . The <unk> Creek Mountains in both Oregon and Nevada border the <unk> Creek Mountains on the southwest ; the two ranges are separated by <unk> Cabin Creek and South Fork <unk> Creek . South of the <unk> Creek Mountains is the Kings River Valley , which separates the <unk> Creek Mountains on the west from the Montana Mountains on the east . 
 The terrain in the <unk> Creek Mountains varies from broad , flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock <unk> cut by deep canyons . The canyons have steep walls with loose <unk> slopes at the <unk> . There are meadows around springs in the mountains , although most streams in the range do not flow year @-@ round . Major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include ( from west to east ) <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , and <unk> Creek . These streams all flow into <unk> basins in Harney County , Oregon . <unk> Creek and <unk> Creek are the largest of the four . The Kings River and <unk> Creek each drain an area on the south slopes of the <unk> Creek Mountains . The Kings River begins in The <unk> and flows south into Nevada , where it meets the Quinn River , which <unk> in the Black Rock Desert . <unk> Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The <unk> and flows generally east , crossing the Oregon – Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of <unk> .

 The mountains lie within the Basin and Range Province or Great Basin of the Western United States , which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north – south mountain ranges separated by wide , high @-@ desert valleys . The <unk> Creek Mountains are <unk> and <unk> blocks with steep <unk> along the southern and eastern sides of the range . The southern area of the range , known as The <unk> , has numerous <unk> of Cretaceous age granite . These granite <unk> are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic <unk> . 
 The <unk> Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where <unk> Mountain is today . <unk> thinning and the Yellowstone <unk> , which was then beneath southeastern Oregon , induced eruptions from <unk> and nearby <unk> about 17 million years ago , in the Miocene . The <unk> produced a series of <unk> flows that spread across the land now known as the <unk> Creek Mountains . <unk> from the <unk> volcano lasted for about one million years , and at least 70 separate <unk> flows occurred . Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older <unk> rocks that may be related to some of the <unk> age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon . Within these <unk> rocks are <unk> and <unk> <unk> bodies which were presumably <unk> during the Cretaceous Period . 
 The broad <unk> <unk> is a prominent geologic feature in the <unk> Creek Mountains . The oval @-@ shaped <unk> is a collapsed <unk> dome that <unk> the Oregon – Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains . It is about 28 miles ( 45 km ) long and 22 miles ( 35 km ) wide . The <unk> dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene . A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large <unk> dome structure . The <unk> formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago . The <unk> contains significant ore deposits , and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the <unk> . Other areas in the <unk> were mined for ores of antimony , <unk> , and lithium . 
 
 = = Climate = = 
 
 The <unk> Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west . When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range , most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the <unk> Creek Mountains . As a result , the average annual precipitation in the <unk> Creek Mountains is only 8 to 26 inches ( 200 to 660 mm ) per year , with most areas receiving between 8 and 12 inches ( 200 and 300 mm ) annually . Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June . Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months . <unk> at elevations below 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) usually <unk> by April ; however , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid @-@ June . Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the <unk> <unk> . 
 The prevailing winds are from the west @-@ southwest , and they are normally strongest in March and April . <unk> , intense thunderstorms are common between April and October . <unk> in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes .

 <unk> in the <unk> Creek Mountains is dominated by big sagebrush and desert grasses . Other common shrubs include <unk> , snowberry , and <unk> . There are also patches of mountain mahogany in some areas . Common grass species include Idaho <unk> , bluebunch wheatgrass , <unk> , western <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , as well as basin <unk> in some well @-@ drained areas . 
 Less than one percent of the range consists of meadow wetlands and riparian <unk> ( vegetation along stream banks ) . However , these areas are vital to the local ecosystem . The meadows surround springs , which are mostly on gently sloping <unk> or in stream <unk> , and range in size from about 1 to 5 acres ( 0 @.@ 40 to 2 @.@ 02 ha ) . <unk> riparian <unk> follow the year @-@ round streams . Many <unk> areas have <unk> <unk> and <unk> groves . <unk> and alder groves can be found at lower elevations where terrain is <unk> and stream channels are wider . <unk> and rushes are also native to these stream <unk> . Years of heavy livestock grazing in parts of the range resulted in the loss of some grass species , riparian vegetation , and young <unk> and <unk> trees . Restoration of riparian areas began in the early 1970s , and plans to reduce grazing were implemented in the 1980s and early 1990s . However , large <unk> in southeastern Oregon during the summer of 2012 burned much of the range 's vegetation , damaging riparian ecosystems and killing hundreds of grazing cattle .

 Animals in the <unk> Creek Mountains are adapted to the environment of the High Desert . <unk> are common in the open , sagebrush @-@ covered basins , while mule deer live in the cottonwood and <unk> groves . There are also <unk> sheep , cougars , and <unk> in the high country . Jackrabbits and coyotes are prevalent throughout the range . Mustangs sometimes pass through the mountains as they <unk> the Great Basin . Some other mammals include the northern pocket <unk> , mountain <unk> , and <unk> 's ground <unk> . North American <unk> live in and along streams , as do Pacific tree frogs , western <unk> toads , and <unk> snakes . Native bird species include the sage grouse , mountain <unk> , gray @-@ headed <unk> , black @-@ throated gray <unk> , Virginia 's <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , pine <unk> , red <unk> , <unk> , <unk> thrush , northern <unk> , and species of <unk> and eagle . 
 Several streams in the <unk> Creek Mountains are home to trout , including the rare <unk> <unk> trout subspecies . These include <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , Little <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , Fifteen Mile Creek , Indian Creek , Sage Canyon Creek , Line Canyon Creek , and some tributaries of <unk> Creek . <unk> <unk> trout live in small , isolated populations that are often confined to individual streams , many of them in the <unk> Creek Mountains . These populations have significant genetic differences due to their history of isolation . For most of the 20th century , the trout 's numbers declined considerably . It was listed under federal law as an endangered species in 1970 and was reclassified as threatened in 1975 . Reasons for the fish 's decline included habitat degradation from cattle grazing , drought , <unk> , competition with other fish , and <unk> with introduced rainbow trout , which decreased the number of genetically pure <unk> <unk> trout . However , reductions in cattle grazing in riparian zones since the 1980s allowed fish habitat and populations to start to recover .

 The Bureau of Land Management ( <unk> ) administers most land in the <unk> Creek Mountains , but there are also some private lands and some roads in the area . The private lands are mainly used for <unk> along mountain streams , while the <unk> lands include large grazing <unk> for local ranchers ' cattle . At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892 , some of which were staked for gold exploration . Commercial mining has occurred in some areas , mostly near the <unk> <unk> , where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted . <unk> in what was called the <unk> <unk> District produced 270 @,@ 000 <unk> of mercury — "" the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere "" — from <unk> extracted from the <unk> in the 20th century . The two leading mercury @-@ producing mines in North America were the <unk> and <unk> mines on the edge of the <unk> in Nevada . Together , they operated from 1933 to 1989 . The <unk> Mine , the last mercury mine in the United States , closed three years later , in 1992 . However , mineral exploration has continued at the <unk> Mine in the 21st century , and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of <unk> as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <unk> project . 
 The entire mountain range is very remote ; as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness @-@ like experience . <unk> , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities . The only developed recreation site nearby is at <unk> Creek Hot Springs , just south of the <unk> Ranch , where nearby there are miles of trails designated for four @-@ wheel off @-@ road vehicles . Hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , <unk> , <unk> , and rabbits . <unk> on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch @-@ and @-@ release basis . The mountains are also suitable for hiking cross @-@ country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek <unk> . There are more than 100 archaeological sites in the range that document use by Northern <unk> people as long as 7 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 <unk> grazing in the <unk> Creek Mountains began in the late 19th century , and the <unk> currently <unk> grazing <unk> in the area . <unk> can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months . The effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s . 
 
 = = Land @-@ management compromise = = 
 
 By the 1970s and 1980s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the <unk> Creek Mountains and elsewhere in the Great Basin . As a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones . <unk> populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures . These conditions put the rare <unk> <unk> trout population at risk . Since the <unk> was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the <unk> Creek Mountains . 
 Beginning in the early 1970s , the Bureau of Land Management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas . Approximately 20 @,@ 000 <unk> trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing . Next , the agency sought to reform land @-@ use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project . 
 As environmentalists pressed the <unk> to close much of the <unk> Creek Mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the <unk> Rebellion seeking to protect their grazing <unk> . Initially , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades . However , in 1988 , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group . The group 's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone — a plan that would protect both the land 's ecological health and ranchers ' economic needs . 
 Initial members of the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group included : 
 Over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers . Meetings were all open to the public . 
 The group eventually endorsed a grazing management plan that provided for both the ecological health of sensitive riparian areas and the economic well @-@ being of ranchers . In 1989 , the <unk> Ranch agreed to rest two grazing <unk> totaling 50 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 ha ) to restore critical stream <unk> and mountain pastures . The <unk> 's <unk> on Fifteen Mile Creek was rested for three years , and its <unk> Creek pasture received a five @-@ year rest before grazing was resumed . In addition , the grazing season in mountain pastures was reduced from four months to two , and the total number of cattle released in the <unk> areas was reduced from 3 @,@ 800 to 2 @,@ 200 . Finally , sensitive areas were <unk> to protect them from cattle , and additional water sources were constructed away from streams . Other <unk> also agreed to rest specific pastures including the <unk> Creek , <unk> Creek , and <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 In 1991 , the Bureau of Land Management approved a new grazing <unk> management plan . It was based on the agreements made by the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group , and it took effect in 1992 . Since then , vegetation in riparian areas of the <unk> Creek Mountains has recovered , and studies by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have found that the <unk> <unk> trout population , still listed as threatened , is also recovering .

 The $ 261 million project was started in 2002 and completed in December 2005 . It was designed by the <unk> Corporation and built by <unk> Construction Corporation . 
 The interchange is considered by Popular <unk> to be one of "" The World 's 18 <unk> <unk> "" because of its height ( as high as a 12 @-@ story building ) , its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features .

 The High Five Interchange , north of downtown in Dallas , Texas , is a massive five @-@ level freeway interchange . It is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ( Interstate 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US 75 ) , and is the first five @-@ level stack interchange to be built in the city . 
 It replaces the <unk> three @-@ level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing US 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways . The looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic . Left @-@ hand exits contributed to the congestion . Further , its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult . 
 <unk> to the celebratory gesture , the "" High Five "" name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower over the landscape . The interchange is as high as a 12 @-@ story building , and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels ( the "" High Five "" ) , 710 support tiers , and 60 miles of additional highway . The highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground . The lanes of US 75 , which are on the bottom level , are 20 feet ( 6 m ) below ground level , giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top As part of the project , I @-@ 635 was widened to include four dedicated high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes ( <unk> lanes ) that are barrier @-@ separated and <unk> . 
 The roads on the five levels are : 
 Level I : US 75 , an eight lane highway , four lanes going each way 
 Level II : The junction of the two six @-@ lane frontage roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left @-@ turn lanes and <unk> , and easy access to US 75 and I @-@ 635 
 Level III : I @-@ 635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four <unk> lanes ( two going each way ) separated by barriers 
 Level IV and V : Direct connection ramps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf 
 The interchange , with its decorative <unk> on <unk> concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation ( <unk> ) , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art . The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the <unk> Trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange . The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by <unk> . 
 The interchange is considered by Popular <unk> as one of "" The World 's 18 <unk> <unk> "" , calling it a "" labyrinth of lanes "" and a "" five @-@ level <unk> of engineering "" because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features .

 The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing , <unk> interchange that accommodated 500 @,@ 000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in Dallas . It was a collaborative project between the <unk> , affected motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor , <unk> Construction . An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible . 
 Reasons for upgrading the interchange , in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access . 
 <unk> Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by <unk> , the largest ever by that agency . The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts . For example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength ( the first time <unk> had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a <unk> scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years . Also built into the construction contract was a provision that <unk> was charged for "" lane rentals "" by <unk> for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on <unk> assessments and the time of day the lane was closed . The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours . In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and <unk> so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished . 
 To save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed : The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans ( used to direct @-@ connect roads ) to be made of steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast @-@ in @-@ place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans . However , <unk> decided to use <unk> concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by Deal <unk> of Italy and costing about $ 1 million , to move the pieces into place . 
 During the construction , 2 @.@ 2 million cubic yards of <unk> was used , 350 @,@ 000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and 300 @,@ 000 square feet of retaining walls were built . Additionally , 40 @,@ 000 feet of drilled shafts and 75 @,@ 000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed . In addition to the construction of 43 permanent bridges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting in 2 @.@ 3 million square feet of bridge deck . 
 The project was designed by the <unk> Corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , which had begun in 2002 and was completed in December 2005 , more than 13 months sooner than planned .

 Meridian is the sixth largest city in the state of Mississippi , in the United States . It is the county seat of Lauderdale County and the principal city of the Meridian , Mississippi <unk> Statistical Area . Along major highways , the city is 93 mi ( 150 km ) east of Jackson , Mississippi ; 154 mi ( <unk> km ) west of Birmingham , Alabama ; 202 mi ( 325 km ) northeast of New Orleans , Louisiana ; and 231 mi ( 372 km ) southeast of Memphis , Tennessee . 
 Established in 1860 , at the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and Southern Railway of Mississippi , Meridian 's economy was built on the railways and goods transported on them , and it became a strategic trading center . During the American Civil War , General William <unk> Sherman burned much of the city to the ground in the Battle of Meridian ( February , 1864 ) . 
 <unk> after the war , the city entered a "" Golden Age "" it become the largest city in Mississippi between 1890 and 1930 , and a leading center for manufacturing in the South , with 44 trains arriving and departing daily . Union Station , built in 1906 , is now a multi @-@ modal center , giving access to the Meridian Transit System , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , averaging 242 @,@ 360 passengers per year . Although the economy slowed with the decline of the railroad industry , the city has diversified , with healthcare , military , and manufacturing employing the most people in 2010 .

 The area is served by two military facilities , Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field , which provide over 4 @,@ 000 jobs . <unk> Meridian is home to the Regional Counter @-@ <unk> Training Academy ( <unk> ) and the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state . Key Field is named after brothers Fred and Al Key , who set a world endurance flight record in 1935 . The field is now home to the 186th Air <unk> Wing of the Air National Guard and a support facility for the <unk> Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard . Rush Foundation Hospital is the largest non @-@ military employer in the region , employing 2 @,@ 610 people . 
 Among the city 's many arts organizations and historic buildings are the Riley Center , the Meridian Museum of Art , Meridian Little Theatre , and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra . Meridian was home to two Carnegie libraries , one for whites and one for African Americans . The Carnegie Branch Library , now demolished , was one of a number of Carnegie libraries built for blacks in the Southern United States during the segregation era . 
 The city has been selected as the future location of the Mississippi Arts and Entertainment Center ( <unk> ) . <unk> <unk> , the "" Father of Country Music "" , was born in Meridian . Highland Park houses a museum which displays <unk> of his life and career , as well as railroad equipment from the steam @-@ engine era . The park is also home to the Highland Park <unk> <unk> , a National Historic Landmark . It is the world 's only two @-@ row stationary <unk> menagerie in existence . Other notable natives include Miss America 1986 Susan <unk> , James <unk> – an activist who was killed in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders in 1964 , and Hartley <unk> , founder of <unk> <unk> headquartered in Meridian . The federal <unk> was the site of the 1966 @-@ 1967 trial of suspects in the murder of <unk> and two other activists ; it was the first time a white jury convicted a white official of a civil rights killing . 
 
 = = History = = 
 
 Previously inhabited by the <unk> Native Americans , the area now called Meridian was obtained by the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing <unk> Creek in 1830 during the period of Indian <unk> . After the treaty was ratified , European @-@ American settlers began to move into the area . 
 After receiving a federal land grant of about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( <unk> ha ) , Richard <unk> , the first settler of Meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . Most of <unk> 's land was bought in 1853 by Lewis A. <unk> , a lawyer from Alabama . John T. Ball , a merchant from <unk> County , bought the remaining 80 acres ( 0 @.@ 32 km2 ) . <unk> and Ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections . 
 There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement . Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name "" Meridian , "" believing the term to be synonymous with "" junction "" ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred "" <unk> "" ( meaning "" mad river "" in a Native American language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and <unk> proposed "" <unk> City . "" Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – the sign on which would alternate between "" Meridian "" and "" <unk> "" each day . Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left "" Meridian "" on the station permanently . The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10 , 1860 . 
 Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in 1861 . Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war . During the Battle of Meridian in 1864 , General William <unk> Sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense <unk> ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . Sherman is reported to have said afterwards , "" Meridian , with its depots , store @-@ houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and <unk> no longer exists . "" Despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26 working days after the battle . Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses . 
 The town <unk> in the aftermath of the Civil War , and experienced its "" Golden Age "" from 1880 to 1910 . The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . As the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area . Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South . Many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the Grand Opera House in 1890 , the <unk> School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the <unk> Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 . 
 The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s . Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses . With <unk> becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression , the S. H. Kress & Co. building , built to "" provide luxury to the common man , "" opened in downtown Meridian , as did the Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house . The federal <unk> was built in 1933 as a <unk> project . 
 After a brief <unk> of the economy at the end of the Depression , the country entered World War II , which renewed the importance of railroads . The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so Meridian became the region 's rail center again . This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails . The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas . 
 During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , Meridian was home to a Council of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) office and several other activist organizations . James <unk> and other local residents , along with Michael <unk> , his wife Rita , and Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote . Whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence . In June 1964 , <unk> , <unk> , and Goodman went to <unk> County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian . Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam . 
 Seven <unk> , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal <unk> in Meridian of "" <unk> the victims of their civil rights "" and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial . It was the first time that a white jury had convicted "" a white official in a civil rights killing . "" In 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time . Edgar Ray <unk> was convicted of <unk> and sentenced to 60 years in prison . Meridian later honored <unk> by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service . 
 Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made <unk> easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . After strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city . The Meridian Historic <unk> and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 . 
 Meridian Main Street organized several projects to <unk> downtown , including the construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian 's Golden Age ; it had been demolished . Other projects included the renovation of the <unk> Building in 2001 and <unk> 's Restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design . Meridian Main Street , along with The Riley Foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the "" Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts . "" 
 After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown <unk> effort . The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . Plans were underway to renovate the <unk> Building , but newly elected Mayor <unk> Barry killed the plans in early 2010 .

 Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Meridian reached its "" Golden Age , "" several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers . The <unk> Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 . Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 . Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District . 
 As the city grew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven @-@ story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927 . Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building . In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark . 
 The <unk> Young Hotel was built in 1931 . A staple in the African @-@ American business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room . 
 As the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . <unk> of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel . The <unk> Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose , but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations . The <unk> Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events .

Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian , but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949 , exhibitions were held at various locations around the city . After the Carnegie library at 25th <unk> and 7th St was closed , the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits . The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults . Over thirty exhibitions are held annually , ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials , photography , crafts , and many other works of art .

 Early public education in Meridian was based on the 1870 Mississippi Constitution . From 1870 to 1885 , trustees appointed by the City Council served on the Board of School Directors , which had authority to operate the schools . Although there were several schools in the city before 1884 , they were privately owned and only enrolled about 400 students . The city did not build its first publicly owned school until September 1884 . The first public school for blacks in the city was held in facilities rented from St. Paul Methodist Church . The Mississippi Legislature amended the city charter in January 1888 to allow the city to maintain its own municipal school district , and in March of the same year $ 30 @,@ 000 in bonds was approved for the city to build new public schools . From this bond , the <unk> School was built in 1894 , becoming the first brick public school building in the state built for blacks . 
 From this early district and later additions , the Meridian Public School District grew to its current size , which now includes six elementary schools , 3 middle schools , and 3 high schools . The city also contains several private schools including Lamar School , <unk> Christian School , Community Christian School , and St. Patrick 's Catholic School . The campus of Meridian High School , the main high school in the district , occupies 37 acres ( 15 ha ) , including six buildings and 111 classrooms . The school is made up of grades 10 @-@ 12 and <unk> approximately 1 @,@ 500 students . 
 Meridian is home to two post @-@ secondary educational institutions . Meridian Community College , founded in 1937 , is located at 910 Highway 19 N and offers free tuition for four <unk> to graduates from the Meridian Public and Lauderdale County School <unk> as well as <unk> children who reside inside Lauderdale County .

 Meridian is served by the Meridian @-@ Lauderdale County Public Library , located at the corner of 7th Street and 26th Avenue . The city originally had two Carnegie libraries , both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites . A group of women had formed the <unk> Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising money to build a library for the city . The books they collected and shared within the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian . With wide support for the library , the club enlisted Israel Marks , a city leader , to approach the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance . The library for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul Methodist Church , and the library for whites was established in a building originally owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian , who sold it to the city on September 25 , 1911 . The African American library was the only library for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library ever built for African Americans in the country . The two libraries served the city until 1967 , when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , combined their collections , and moved all materials to their current location . The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian Museum of Art in 1970 , and the former African @-@ American library was demolished on May 28 , 2008 .

 Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console . The game was first released in North America , Europe and Australia in June 1991 , and in Japan the following month . The game features an anthropomorphic <unk> named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. <unk> , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos <unk> . Sonic the Hedgehog 's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button . 
 The game 's development began in 1990 , when Sega ordered its <unk> development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company . After considering a number of suggestions , the developers decided on a blue <unk> with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves "" Sonic Team "" to match their character . Sonic the Hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , was influenced by the games of Super Mario series creator , Shigeru Miyamoto . Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic 's sprite to roll along curved scenery , which originated in a tech demo created by the game 's programmer , <unk> <unk> . 
 The game was well received by critics , who praised its visuals , music , and speed of gameplay . The game was also commercially successful , establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16 @-@ bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super <unk> console . It has been ported a number of times , and inspired several <unk> , a successful franchise , and adaptations by other media .

 In an attempt to steal the six Chaos <unk> and <unk> their power , the game 's antagonist , Dr. Ivo <unk> , has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules . The player controls Sonic , who aims to halt <unk> 's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the <unk> himself . 
 If the player collects all the Chaos <unk> and completes the game , a reward ending sequence is shown . If all the <unk> are not collected , <unk> taunts the player while <unk> the Chaos <unk> instead . 
 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 
 Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D , side @-@ scrolling platformer , whose gameplay centers around Sonic 's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs , slopes , high falls , and loop @-@ the @-@ loops . The levels contain <unk> in the form of robots ( "" <unk> "" in the Western game manuals ) inside of which Dr. <unk> has trapped animals . Although destroying a robot frees the animal within , this is not required to complete the game . The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes , falling into <unk> pits , being crushed by moving walls or platforms , and drowning ( which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from <unk> ) . Sonic 's main attack is his spin , where he <unk> into a ball and <unk> rapidly ( damaging enemies and some obstacles ) . This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground . 
 <unk> around each level map are gold rings , and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life . <unk> are a layer of protection against <unk> ; if Sonic has at least one ring when he <unk> with an enemy ( or obstacle ) , he will survive . However , all his rings will be scattered ; they will <unk> and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again . If Sonic is hit without any rings , he loses a life . Although shields and temporary <unk> may be collected to provide additional protection , certain <unk> ( such as drowning , being crushed , falling down a <unk> pit or running out of time ) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection . 
 The game is divided into six zones ( Green Hill , <unk> , Spring Yard , Labyrinth , Star Light , and <unk> Brain ) , each with its own visual style and enemies . A player must navigate through each zone ( subdivided into three acts ) to progress . At the end of each zone 's third act , the player confronts Dr. <unk> ( who pilots a different vehicle each time ) in a boss fight . After the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with <unk> . 
 The player begins with three lives ( power @-@ ups and rings add more ) , which are lost when Sonic <unk> with hazardous enemies ( or objects ) without rings , falls off @-@ screen or exceeds an act 's ten @-@ minute time limit . <unk> acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most @-@ recently activated post when he loses a life . If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life , the <unk> will reset to 0 : 00 when he returns to the <unk> . If all lives are lost at any point in the game , the game over screen will appear ( when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives , if they have any continues ) . 
 When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings , a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage ( a "" Secret Zone "" in the original Genesis manual ) . In each of six Special <unk> , Sonic <unk> off the <unk> and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack . Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found , their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a "" goal block "" ( which ends the level ) .

 In 1990 , Sega ordered its in @-@ house development studio , <unk> , to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company . This was a position already held by the character Alex <unk> , but he was considered similar to Mario and deemed unsatisfactory ; Sega president <unk> <unk> wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse . Sega had competition from Nintendo and its mascot , Mario , in mind ; Nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros. 3 , and Sega wanted a foothold in the industry . Although the company had some success with Genesis ports of its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough . 
 <unk> developed ideas for characters , an engine , and gameplay mechanics . Development emphasized speed , so <unk> eliminated character designs not associated with fast animals , as well as fast creatures like <unk> and squirrels . One idea , a <unk> able to grasp objects with prehensile ears , showed promise at first but was too complex for the available hardware . The team narrowed its search to animals that can roll into a ball , their idea for an attacking move . <unk> then realized that this would not seem aggressive enough , so they focused on two animals with spikes : <unk> and <unk> . The <unk> character , first proposed by <unk> <unk> , prevailed , although the <unk> would later become the basis for Mighty the <unk> ( who first appeared in 1993 's <unk> the Hedgehog ) . <unk> has admitted since that he created Sonic 's basic design by combining Felix the Cat 's head with Mickey Mouse 's body . 
 Sonic was originally <unk> @-@ colored , then a light shade of blue , but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the Sega logo . His shoes were colored red through the inspiration of Michael Jackson 's boots on the album cover for Bad and the outfit of Santa Claus , whom <unk> saw as the most "" famous character in the world "" . Sonic 's spikes were emphasized to make him look <unk> , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping ( so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button ) . The new character was originally named "" Mr. <unk> "" , but the eight @-@ member <unk> changed his name to "" Sonic "" and their studios to Sonic Team . <unk> proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band , giving him vampire fangs , and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna , but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple . Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a <unk> is and initially proposed a full @-@ scale recreation of the character , but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes . The antagonist ended up being named "" Dr. <unk> "" in Japan and "" Dr. <unk> "" in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega 's American and Japanese divisions .

 With a satisfying protagonist completed , Sega turned to esteemed programmer <unk> <unk> , who had impressed them through his work on <unk> Star and the Genesis port of <unk> ' n <unk> . The gameplay originated with a tech demo by <unk> , who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a dot matrix . <unk> 's prototype was a platform game with a fast @-@ moving character rolling in a ball through a long , winding tube , and this concept was <unk> out with <unk> 's character designs and levels by designer <unk> <unk> . <unk> originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the Gulf War , but was <unk> in the project for nearly a year . His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design . The game 's color scheme was influenced by the work of pop artist <unk> Suzuki , and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of California . 
 In designing the game mechanics , <unk> was inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto , whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier . <unk> the simplicity of Miyamoto 's mechanics in complex environments , <unk> decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a directional pad for movement and a single button for jumping . He also wanted his creation to be more action @-@ oriented than the Mario series ; while playing Super Mario Bros. , he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly . Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis ' technological prowess , the developing game underwent extensive testing and redesign , a process taking over six months . The developers ' efforts were rewarded ; according to <unk> <unk> , the game had the fastest @-@ ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that was considered impossible on the console . The team intended to add a two @-@ player mode displayed via split @-@ screen , but <unk> 's programming knowledge was insufficient to implement this feature . However , such a mode would later appear in sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ( 1992 ) , where the second player would control Sonic 's best friend Miles "" <unk> "" <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months . 
 <unk> 's relationship with Sega of Japan was tenuous during this time ; he received little credit for his involvement in the game . He left the company shortly after the game 's release , although Sega of America hired him later . Before leaving , however , he defied Sega of Japan 's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background , identifiable only by looking at the game 's code .

 The music for Sonic the Hedgehog was composed and produced by Masato <unk> , bassist and lead songwriter of the J @-@ pop band Dreams Come True . The game uses <unk> Yamaha <unk> and <unk> programmable sound generators to produce a variety of <unk> sound effects and music . It was originally intended to have a sound test menu with animations of Sonic <unk> to the music of a "" Sonic Band "" of <unk> <unk> on guitar , Max Monkey on bass , <unk> <unk> on drums , and <unk> the Crocodile on keyboard . The playable <unk> became a recurring character in the series , also appearing in <unk> ' <unk> , Sonic Heroes , and Sonic Free <unk> . The development schedule scrapped the feature , and <unk> <unk> replaced the test with the "" Se @-@ <unk> ! "" chant used in TV commercials ( which reportedly used one @-@ eighth of the memory of the four @-@ <unk> cartridge ) . 
 On October 19 , 2011 , twenty years after the game 's release , a three @-@ disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released in Japan . The first disc features original tracks from both games , the second contains Masato <unk> 's demo recordings and the third comprises songs by Dreams Come True and their <unk> remixes .

 Game @-@ package illustrator Akira <unk> said that his goal was to make the characters "" colorful "" , using clear lines and <unk> to "" finish them <unk> "" . According to <unk> , the developers asked him to create a package design "" similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages "" – something "" original "" and "" stylish "" . The game was released in North America , Europe , and Australia on June 23 , 1991 , and in Japan on July 26 . Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles , replacing <unk> Beast .

 Sonic the Hedgehog was critically praised at its release and in retrospective reviews , with an 86 @-@ percent approval rating at the review aggregator GameRankings based on nine reviews . The game rivaled the Mario series , particularly Super Mario World ( which was recently released for Genesis rival Super Nintendo Entertainment System ) . Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games compared the two in depth and characterized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster , with brighter colors , and Super Mario World as having more "" depth of play "" . 
 Reviewers noted the game 's colorful , detailed graphics . Rand called its color scheme "" lively , but never <unk> "" , praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites , backgrounds , and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis . Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds "" eye @-@ popping "" and "" gorgeous "" , which was echoed by Mean Machines . According to the <unk> ( Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk ) of Dragon , "" The graphics and animation in Sonic the Hedgehog make this a serious contender for the best video game of the year "" and <unk> called the animation "" some of the <unk> and fastest ... ever seen "" . The music and sound effects were also well received ; Dragon called them "" great "" , and <unk> "" amazing "" . Rand noted "" <unk> of catchy tunes and <unk> "" , calling some of the sound effects "" absolutely brilliant "" . Although Mean Machines called the songs "" vaguely appealing "" , the game 's sound effects were better appreciated . 
 Critics cited the fast gameplay , unprecedented in <unk> . GamePro 's Boogie Man noted its "" lightning @-@ fast action "" and , according to Electronic Gaming Monthly ( <unk> ) , "" If you thought the Enterprise was quick , wait till you see Sonic at <unk> speed . "" The game 's difficulty was disputed , described as "" impossible "" by Rand and "" average "" by <unk> . Rand said about the gameplay in general that it "" plays like a dream "" ; according to <unk> it would <unk> players for hours , and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team 's ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping . Although <unk> , Dragon , and Paul of Mean Machines praised the level design ( especially the hidden rooms ) , Paul found losing all of one 's rings frustrating . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity , appearing on lists of the greatest video games of all time . Frank <unk> of GameSpot described the game as "" one of the best <unk> of all time "" , noting that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port "" after all these years , the underlying graphics , audio , and gameplay still hold up "" . Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time : "" You 'll be impressed by the clarity and color that come through ... Few people realize how difficult it was to create Sonic 's graphics engine , which allowed for the incredible rate of speed the game 's known for . But the technical achievement impressed back in ' 91 , and still does so today . "" Mega ranked the game its third @-@ favorite Genesis title , and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th @-@ greatest game of all time . Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success ; the original Genesis version sold over 15 million copies by February 2009 , and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by 2008 .

 Primarily because of its Genesis <unk> , Sonic the Hedgehog contributed to the console 's North American popularity . During October – December 1991 , the Genesis <unk> the Super <unk> by a two @-@ to @-@ one ratio , and at its January 1992 peak claimed 65 percent of the market for 16 @-@ bit consoles . Although Nintendo eventually again overtook Sega , this was the first time since December 1985 that the company did not lead the console market . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog added speed and momentum @-@ based physics to the standard platform formula . Set @-@ pieces and mechanics introduced by the game ( such as loops , springs , and acceleration pads ) have appeared in other games and become associated with the Sonic series . 
 A flood of "" animal with attitude "" <unk> , each featuring a cartoon mascot , were released after Sonic the Hedgehog : <unk> , Aero the <unk> @-@ Bat , James Pond 3 , <unk> Jim , Zero the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the Tasmanian Tiger , <unk> .

Sonic has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters ( keeping Sonic and <unk> as <unk> ) , surviving the end of Sega console manufacturing after the <unk> . The series has ventured from <unk> to fighting , racing , role @-@ playing , and sports games , and has expanded into anime and manga , cartoons and comic books , novels , and toys . Sonic the Hedgehog has become one of the best @-@ selling video game franchises of all time , with over 150 million copies sold by May 2014 .

 = U.S. Route 2 in Michigan = 
 
 US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) is a component of the United States <unk> Highway System that connects Everett , Washington , to the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan , with a separate segment that runs from <unk> Point , New York , to <unk> , Maine . In Michigan , the highway runs through the UP in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering the state at <unk> and ending at St. Ignace ; in between , US 2 briefly traverses the state of Wisconsin . As one of the major transportation <unk> in the UP , US 2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern Midwest states . Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle <unk> , and other segments are listed as state @-@ designated Pure Michigan <unk> . There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along US 2 that date to the <unk> and 1920s . The highway runs through rural sections of the UP , passing through two national and two state forests in the process . 
 The route of what became US 2 was used as part of two Indian trails before European settlers came to the UP , and as part of the Michigan segments of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway and the King 's International Highway auto trails in the early 20th century . The state later included these trails as part of M ‑ 12 when the first state highway <unk> were designated in 1919 . Most of M ‑ 12 was redesignated as part of US 2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 . Since the 1930s , several changes have <unk> the highway 's routing through the UP . One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley , Wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of US 2 closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline . With the creation of the Interstate Highway System , part of US 2 was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) , though in the 1980s , the U.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I ‑ 75 freeway , resulting in today 's basic form .

 According to a 2006 regional planning committee report , US 2 is a key highway for Michigan , providing its main western gateway . The roadway plays "" an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the Midwest "" , and is listed on the National Highway System ( NHS ) for its entire length . The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . Together with M ‑ 28 , US 2 is part of a pair of primary <unk> that bridge the eastern and western sides of the UP . The 305 @.@ 151 miles ( 491 @.@ <unk> km ) of roadway in Michigan is divided into a 109 @.@ 177 @-@ mile ( 175 @.@ 703 km ) western segment and a 195 @.@ <unk> @-@ mile ( 315 @.@ 390 km ) eastern segment , interrupted by a section that runs for 14 @.@ 460 miles ( 23 @.@ 271 km ) in the state of Wisconsin .

 US 2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for the first time north of downtown Hurley , Wisconsin , and <unk> , Michigan , over the state line that runs along the Montreal River . The highway crosses the river into <unk> County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown . Running along <unk> Drive , US 2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard . The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown <unk> and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway . The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line . US 2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of <unk> . While bypassing the community of Ramsay , the highway crosses a branch of the Black River . The roadway enters Wakefield on the south side of Sunday Lake , meeting M ‑ 28 at a <unk> in town . As the US Highway leaves Wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest , crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the <unk> Isle River . US 2 and M ‑ 64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the <unk> Isle in the community of <unk> . This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state ; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770 vehicles , compared to the overall average of 5 @,@ 188 vehicles for the highway . At the end of the concurrency , M ‑ 64 turns northerly to run along Lake <unk> . 
 The highway continues parallel to the state line from the <unk> area through the national forest toward <unk> . That unincorporated community is the home of the <unk> High School <unk> , the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel . The area is also where the waters meet ; the rolling hills drain to Lake Superior via the <unk> River , to Lake Michigan via the <unk> and <unk> rivers , or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers . Also located in the area are the <unk> Wilderness , and the Lac <unk> Desert Indian <unk> , which includes the Lac <unk> Desert Casino and Resort . The highway travels southeasterly from <unk> around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County . US 2 intersects Federal Forest Highway 16 ( <unk> 16 ) near Golden Lake in <unk> Township in the middle of the national forest . The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M ‑ 73 . In town , US 2 intersects M ‑ 189 before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city . 
 US 2 leaves the Ottawa National Forest at Iron River , and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to Crystal Falls , the county seat of Iron County . On the west side of town , US 2 meets US 141 ; the two highways run concurrently along Crystal Avenue . The combined highway turns south onto 5th Street and meets M ‑ 69 's eastern terminus at the intersection between 5th Street and Superior Avenue next to the county <unk> at the top of the hill . US 2 / US 141 runs south out of Crystal Falls to the west of , and parallel to , the <unk> River . The roadway passes Railroad , Kennedy and <unk> lakes and leaves the state of Michigan at the <unk> River , crossing into Florence County , Wisconsin for about 14 miles ( 23 km ) .

 US 2 / US 141 re @-@ enters Michigan where it crosses the <unk> River and subsequently meets M ‑ 95 in <unk> Township north of Iron Mountain and <unk> . The highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on <unk> Avenue into Iron Mountain along the west side of Lake Antoine , parallel to a branch line of the <unk> and Lake Superior Railroad ( <unk> Railroad ) . The road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the <unk> Mine . In downtown Iron Mountain at <unk> Street , M ‑ 95 turns west off <unk> Avenue to run across town to <unk> . US 2 / US 141 exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the <unk> Mall . The highway re @-@ enters <unk> Township where US 141 separates to the south to re @-@ enter Wisconsin . US 2 continues eastward parallel to a branch of the Canadian National Railway ( <unk> Railway ) . Both road and rail travel through the community of <unk> , where they pass near the largest paper mill in the UP . The trunkline runs along the main street of Norway , where the highway meets the eastern terminus of US 8 . Then US 2 continues east through rural Dickinson County to Vulcan , passing north of <unk> Lake through the <unk> Country State Forest , before crossing the Sturgeon River in <unk> and passing into <unk> County . 
 In <unk> County , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along US 2 . The highway passes through the edge of the community of <unk> before entering Powers . US 2 comes to a three @-@ way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US 41 . The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and <unk> on the south side of the <unk> Railway . At Harris , the trunkline enters the <unk> Indian Community . Harris is on the <unk> County side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to <unk> River on the Delta County side . The county line in between not only separates the two communities , but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones . East of <unk> River , the highway crosses the community 's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M ‑ 69 . The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of <unk> . 
 US 2 / US 41 <unk> to four lanes along <unk> Street , which forms the east – west axis of the <unk> street grid . Near downtown , the highway meets M ‑ 35 , which runs along the city 's north – south axis , Lincoln Avenue . The <unk> merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor . Lincoln Avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the Upper Peninsula State <unk> , site of one of the two state <unk> for the state of Michigan , the only state to have twin <unk> . US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 continues north on Lincoln Avenue past the campus of Bay de <unk> Community College . The four @-@ lane highway crosses the <unk> River just upstream from its mouth near the large Mead Paper Mill and shifts to run immediately next to Little Bay de <unk> . The section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of US 2 in the state : an average of 23 @,@ 977 vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in 2011 . 
 The road turns inland again , and US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 passes to the west of downtown Gladstone . The highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median and no <unk> access . Unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges . The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) and crosses the <unk> Railroad south of the <unk> for 4th Avenue North , where M ‑ 35 separates from the US Highways and turns to the northwest . The expressway continues north parallel to the <unk> Railway , crossing the Days River . Through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) for car traffic . This is the only road in the UP with a speed limit higher than 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) besides I @-@ 75 , which has a speed limit of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . The expressway segment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de <unk> before ending at Rapid River . In this location , US 41 separates to the north , and US 2 returns to an easterly track as a two @-@ lane road , crossing the Rapid and <unk> rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay . As US 2 crosses southern Delta County , it passes through the western unit of the <unk> National Forest . Near Garden Corners , the highway runs along the shore of Big Bay de <unk> . After the intersection with the northern terminus of M ‑ 183 , US 2 turns inland cutting across the base of the Garden Peninsula and enters Schoolcraft County . 
 As the highway approaches Thompson , US 2 leaves the western unit of the <unk> National Forest and enters the Lake Superior State Forest . The roadway runs along Lake Michigan to <unk> , crossing the <unk> River . The trunkline turns inland approaching <unk> and then turns north @-@ northeast to Blaney Park . The community there is a former logging town @-@ turned @-@ resort at the southern terminus of M ‑ 77 ; the resort was active from the late 1920s but declined by the 1980s . From Blaney Park , US 2 turns due east and crosses into Mackinac County west of Gould City . Where it intersects a former routing , the main highway crosses the <unk> Railway one last time and runs to the south of <unk> to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline through <unk> . After passing the community of <unk> , US 2 crosses the Cut River Bridge , 147 feet ( 45 m ) over the Cut River . The highway crosses into the eastern unit of the <unk> National Forest near <unk> , running between Lake Michigan and <unk> Lake in the process . The road continues along the Lake Michigan shoreline , passing <unk> Spot near <unk> Cap and turning inland immediately west of St. Ignace . The US 2 designation ends at the highway 's partial cloverleaf interchange with I ‑ 75 . The roadway continues easterly into downtown St. Ignace as Business Loop I ‑ 75 ( BL I ‑ 75 ) .

 = = = Indian trail through auto trails = = = 
 
 In 1701 , the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes , rivers and Indian trails . Two of these trails followed parts of the future US 2 . The <unk> – Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US 2 between <unk> and St. Ignace . The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with <unk> <unk> . Marie . 
 In the age of the auto trail , the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names . When the original roadways between <unk> and Iron River were completed in late 1915 , the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau ( <unk> ) named the area <unk> and the highway the <unk> Trail . Later the name was extended over the highway to <unk> , and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s ; the name was phased out by the <unk> completely in 1927 . The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway , named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919 . Overall , this highway ran from Portland , Oregon , to Portland , Maine , by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario . Through the UP , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US 2 , including the section through Florence County , Wisconsin . 
 The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the <unk> . A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle <unk> by seventy years , the route followed "" a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ... "" This route followed the modern US 2 from <unk> to the M ‑ 94 junction in <unk> , using the modern M ‑ 69 and M ‑ 95 to stay in Michigan . <unk> of the route followed US 41 and M ‑ 35 between Powers and <unk> . The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan . The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. 
 One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well . In 1920 , the King 's International Highway linked Vancouver , British Columbia , to Halifax , Nova Scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior . <unk> had to ship their cars by boat between <unk> <unk> . Marie , Ontario , and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail . The <unk> varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from <unk> to <unk> <unk> . Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960 ; by that time , the auto trail had taken on the Trans @-@ Canada Highway name .

 The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M ‑ 12 , a designation that was in use by July 1 , 1919 , between <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Marie . The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert <unk> near what is now US 2 near Iron River in 1919 – 20 , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside US 16 ( Grand River Avenue ) in 1929 south of <unk> . When the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , US 2 partially replaced M @-@ 12 . Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain , US 2 was routed through Florence , Wisconsin . The former routing of M ‑ 12 from Crystal Falls to <unk> became a new M ‑ 69 when the former M ‑ 69 became US 102 ( now US 141 ) . M ‑ 12 from <unk> south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M ‑ 45 , which is now M ‑ 95 . By the next year , M ‑ 48 was added along US 2 from <unk> to <unk> as part of a larger extension . 
 The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown <unk> . A larger <unk> was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park and <unk> <unk> . Marie . The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to <unk> and north to <unk> <unk> . Marie ; the former routing was given the M ‑ 121 designation . Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2 / US 141 to a new bridge over the <unk> River between 1932 and 1934 . Downtown <unk> was bypassed in 1934 , and the former route was initially designated M ‑ 54 . 
 The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) changed the <unk> and designations of the highways around <unk> , Thompson and <unk> in the mid @-@ 1930s . The agency rerouted US 2 between <unk> and M ‑ 149 in Thompson , turning the old road back to county control . The section between M ‑ 149 and M ‑ 125 was redesignated as an extension of M ‑ 149 to Thompson , and M ‑ 125 was replaced by a further extension of M ‑ 149 . The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on August 2 , 1936 . 
 The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time . Between <unk> and <unk> , US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the <unk> Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula . The new routing took US 2 along the <unk> into St. Ignace . US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park ; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M ‑ 122 . Further changes in the early 1940s <unk> the roadway out near <unk> and Crystal Falls . 
 Additional <unk> were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern <unk> routing between Gould City and <unk> in 1941 . The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to <unk> and then along the lake to <unk> . The former route through <unk> was turned back to local control as far east as <unk> . From there east , it was numbered just M ‑ 48 , removing US 2 from a concurrency . Another former section into <unk> was added to extend M ‑ 117 . The new highway was <unk> around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II . 
 The western end of US 2 took on two changes in the 1940s . M ‑ 28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at <unk> from its western terminus at Wakefield . A similar extension was made from M ‑ 28 's eastern terminus to <unk> <unk> . Marie in 1948 . The M ‑ 54 designation was renumbered as Business US 2 by 1945 . The eastern M ‑ 28 extension was reversed in 1950 , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952 . 
 
 = = = Interstate era = = = 
 
 With the coming of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan , the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US 2 to a freeway between St. Ignace and <unk> St. Marie . In planning maps from 1947 , this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the <unk> . It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas <unk> in September 1955 , or Yellow Book after the cover color , that was released in 1955 as the federal government <unk> plans for the freeway system . The proposed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) . 
 The first section of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between <unk> <unk> and M ‑ 123 north of St. Ignace . The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November 1 , 1957 ; a new section of freeway and an interchange connected US 2 to the bridge . In 1961 , another new freeway segment closed the gap between the Mackinac Bridge and <unk> <unk> sections . At the time , the I ‑ 75 designation <unk> US 27 on the bridge , and US 2 was shifted to follow I ‑ 75 along the freeways in the St. Ignace area . The former routing of US 2 in downtown St. Ignace was redesignated BL I ‑ 75 . More sections of freeway were opened in 1962 immediately to the south of the newly constructed International Bridge in <unk> <unk> . Marie as well as between <unk> and <unk> . The last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at M ‑ 123 to <unk> , and the section between <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Marie . At this time , all of US 2 's former routing became a county road known as Mackinac Trail ( H @-@ 63 ) . 
 The Department of State Highways expanded US 2 / US 41 into an expressway between Gladstone and Rapid River in 1971 . The state built a new bridge over the <unk> River in 1983 , bypassing downtown . MDOT disposed of the former routing of US 2 into downtown in two ways . The western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control . An extension of M ‑ 94 replaced the remainder , including the <unk> Bridge , through downtown . In that same year , the department truncated US 2 to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I ‑ 75 freeway . The last changes were made to US 2 's routing through Iron River in 1998 , bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town . In 2011 , MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County from 55 to 65 mph ( 89 to 105 km / h ) , although the speed limit for trucks remains 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) . 
 
 = = Memorial designations and tourist routes = = 
 
 On July 1 , 1924 , the State Administrative Board named M ‑ 12 , the predecessor to US 2 in Michigan , the <unk> Highway to honor Frank P. <unk> , a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress from 1927 to 1933 . In 1929 , the residents of <unk> created a memorial to the veterans of World War I called Memory Lane . The project consisted of <unk> and maple trees planted along US 2 / US 41 west of town . The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers . Later in 1949 , the <unk> Women 's Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans . Also called Memory Lane , the group planted 140 <unk> and 1 @,@ 840 <unk> , trees and shrubs as a <unk> parkway along 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) of US 2 east of <unk> . 
 Most of US 2 , along with US 23 in the Lower Peninsula , was designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in 1949 . To connect the gap in the routing where US 2 cuts through Wisconsin , M ‑ 95 and M ‑ 69 were used in place of US 2 between Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls . Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor George W. Romney had them installed . 
 The <unk> Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 between the northern <unk> city limits and County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) in Delta County . The American Veterans ( <unk> ) organization in Michigan petitioned the Michigan Legislature to grant this designation , which was assigned under Public Act 144 in 1959 . 
 Two sections of US 2 are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour ( <unk> ) : the segment from the Wisconsin state line near <unk> to the M ‑ 28 junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( <unk> ) , and the segment from the southern M ‑ 35 junction in <unk> to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( <unk> ) . These two tours were created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin , Minnesota and Ontario . The section of US 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail . This Pure Michigan Byway was designated to honor the "" rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging . "" On August 26 , 2007 , MDOT announced that the section of US 2 that runs concurrently with M ‑ 35 in Delta County was being included in the UP <unk> Coast Recreational Heritage Trail . 
 
 = = Historic bridges = = 
 
 There are six bridges along current or former sections of US 2 that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan 's Historic Bridges ; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( <unk> ) . A third bridge added to the <unk> in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT 's listing however . The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge . The original structure , dating to 1918 , is a 55 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 17 m ) <unk> arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. 191 . The structure was listed on the <unk> on December 9 , 1999 , for its architectural and engineering significance . 
 In December 2012 , the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the <unk> River northwest of Iron Mountain . The structure is a single @-@ span , pin @-@ connected , <unk> , through @-@ <unk> bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan . It was built between 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing . The span cost $ 5 @,@ 106 ( equivalent to $ 780 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties . Until the 1930s , the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the <unk> River . In 1934 , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span . The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971 , and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012 . 
 In 2003 , MDOT replaced the Sturgeon River Bridge in <unk> Township , Dickinson County . As of October 2011 , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced , MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list . It was built in 1929 . 
 Before 1983 , US 2 used a different routing through <unk> and crossed the <unk> River on what is nicknamed the "" <unk> Bridge "" . Built as a part of a <unk> <unk> on the river , the water level is actually higher than the road surface . This produces a <unk> effect , giving the bridge its nickname . The <unk> <unk> and Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the <unk> River to supply their mill . This dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded , and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction . Instead of expensive <unk> , a concrete tank was built <unk> in the river bed ; the sides of this tank provided man @-@ made banks higher than the natural banks . The Michigan Works Progress Administration described the bridge as having "" concrete bulkheads , formed by the side spans of the bridge , [ that ] allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed . "" The <unk> Tourism Council stated : "" At one time , the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was <unk> forced under it , "" and that the bridge has been featured in Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! . The eight @-@ span structure is <unk> feet ( 90 m ) long . 
 The Cut River Bridge carries US 2 across the Cut River in <unk> Township , Mackinac County . This structure was built during World War II but completion was delayed due to war @-@ induced steel shortages . The span uses <unk> short tons ( <unk> long tons ; <unk> t ) of structural steel to bridge the <unk> feet ( 195 m ) over the river and its <unk> at a height of 147 feet ( 45 m ) above the river . The Cut River Bridge is one of only two <unk> deck <unk> bridges in the state . On either side of the bridge , there are picnic areas and trails down to the river . 
 Listed on the <unk> on December 17 , 1999 , the Mackinac Trail – <unk> River Bridge carries H @-@ 63 , the modern successor to US 2 , over the <unk> River north of St. Ignace . The bridge is another <unk> arch structure 60 feet ( 18 m ) in length and built in 1920 . Increasing traffic along Mackinac Trail prompted the MSHD to "" widen its deck by five feet [ 1 @.@ 5 m ] and install new <unk> in the 1929 – 1930 <unk> "" along with the addition of decorative retaining walls . 
 The last of the historic bridges along a former segment of US 2 is the structure carrying <unk> Street ( BS I ‑ 75 ) over the Power Canal in <unk> <unk> . Marie . Built in 1934 , it is one of only three steel arch bridges in the state . The 42 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 13 m ) and 257 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 78 m ) structure is described by MDOT as "" massive "" with an "" innovative "" construction method : the previous structure was used as a <unk> for the current bridge before removal .

 The 1985 <unk> assassination plot was a conspiracy by a group of high @-@ ranking followers of <unk> <unk> <unk> ( later known as <unk> ) to assassinate Charles Turner , the then @-@ United States Attorney for the District of Oregon . <unk> 's personal secretary and second @-@ in @-@ command , Ma Anand <unk> ( <unk> Silverman ) , assembled the group after Turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at <unk> . Turner investigated charges of immigration fraud and <unk> marriages , and later headed the federal prosecution of the 1984 <unk> <unk> attack in The <unk> , Oregon . 
 The conspirators included : Ma Anand <unk> , <unk> @-@ Anne <unk> , Chief Financial Officer of <unk> ; Susan <unk> , head of security at <unk> , Catherine Jane <unk> , who bought weapons and <unk> and volunteered to be the actual murderer ; Ann <unk> McCarthy , fourth @-@ in @-@ command of <unk> ; and co @-@ conspirators Alma Potter , Carol Matthews , <unk> Caldwell and Richard Kevin <unk> . The conspirators obtained false identification to purchase <unk> out @-@ of @-@ state , <unk> Turner , and planned to murder him near his workplace in Portland , Oregon . The assassination plot was never carried out and was only discovered later , as a result of the investigation by federal law enforcement into the <unk> attack in The <unk> and other illegal acts by the <unk> leadership . 
 Prosecution of the conspirators began in 1990 , when a federal grand jury brought <unk> against several of the key players . Some had fled the country , and <unk> proceedings against the <unk> and subsequent prosecution and conviction was not completed for sixteen years . The final <unk> was convicted in 2006 , when Catherine Jane <unk> agreed to return to the United States from Germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in Australia . Eight <unk> received sentences ranging from five years <unk> to five years in federal prison and an additional member of the <unk> commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy . <unk> was never <unk> in relation to the conspiracy , and left the United States after pleading guilty to immigration fraud and agreeing not to <unk> the country without permission from the U.S. Attorney General .

 Seven followers ( called <unk> ) of charismatic leader <unk> <unk> <unk> ( now known as <unk> ) , were convicted of a 1985 conspiracy to assassinate Charles Turner , and an additional <unk> eighth member of the <unk> commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy . The <unk> were high @-@ ranking followers within the <unk> organization . <unk> in the case stated that the <unk> had planned to murder Turner after he was appointed to head an investigation into the group 's activities in <unk> , Oregon . Turner 's investigation focused on <unk> marriages organized by the group , as well as other illegal activities including immigration fraud , and he later headed the federal prosecution relating to the 1984 <unk> <unk> attack in The <unk> , Oregon . Oregon Attorney General Dave <unk> was also involved in investigations of the group , working alongside Turner . 
 In May 1985 , <unk> 's personal secretary and second @-@ in @-@ command , <unk> Silverman ( Ma Anand <unk> ) , gathered the leader 's key followers and formed a group of conspirators in order to plan the assassination of Turner , as well as several dissidents among their organization . <unk> stated that Turner 's grand jury investigation "" threatened the existence of the commune "" , and exposed <unk> and several of his disciples to criminal prosecution . <unk> hoped that by murdering Turner they would be able to thwart the federal immigration investigation which could have resulted in <unk> of <unk> leaders . Three former leaders of the commune including Ma Anand <unk> , <unk> Yvonne <unk> ( Ma Anand <unk> ) , a registered nurse from the Philippines who managed the <unk> medical corporation , and former treasurer of <unk> Foundation International and Catherine Jane <unk> ( Ma <unk> <unk> ) of Australia , put together a hit list which included U.S. Attorney Charles Turner and Oregon Attorney General David <unk> . 
 Susan <unk> ( Ma Anand Su ) , a top official in the <unk> hierarchy , was also a participant in the assassination conspiracy . <unk> was in charge of the security force at <unk> , ran the <unk> Investment Corporation , and supervised construction on the commune . Other conspirators in the assassination plot included Ann <unk> McCarthy ( Ma <unk> <unk> ) , president of the <unk> commune , and Alma Potter ( Ma <unk> <unk> ) , Ma Anand <unk> 's bodyguard and traveling companion . Potter was manager of the Hotel <unk> in Portland , Oregon , and a member of the commune 's security force .

 Catherine Jane <unk> volunteered to be the follower who would actually murder Turner , and bought guns and <unk> . <unk> was known to fellow followers as Ma <unk> <unk> , and was also one of the three "" Big <unk> "" in <unk> . <unk> @-@ Anne <unk> ( known by followers as Ma <unk> <unk> ) , an <unk> and the group 's Chief Financial Officer , provided money for the purchase of weapons related to the plot . <unk> Caldwell ( Ma Deva <unk> ) described in a federal <unk> how members of the murder conspiracy obtained <unk> , referring to Catherine Jane <unk> and <unk> @-@ Anne <unk> : "" <unk> B went down to Jesus Grove , and <unk> gave us several thousand dollars to use to buy guns . "" Jesus Grove referred to a group of trailers where all the leaders of the <unk> commune resided , except for <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 Ma Anand <unk> and three other <unk> followers traveled to New York in the spring of 1985 to acquire false identification . According to a federal <unk> , the <unk> of the assassination plot used a false birth certificate to purchase guns . Two members of the group then traveled to Texas to purchase <unk> . Caldwell stated she and Catherine Jane <unk> flew to Texas to purchase guns there . They purchased five guns in Texas , but encountered difficulty purchasing <unk> in Texas with out @-@ of @-@ state identification and traveled to New Mexico instead . Caldwell said they called back to the commune but the women were instructed "" not to come back without the guns "" . 
 In New Mexico , they obtained false identification , and purchased several pistols . Their intention was to purchase guns which were difficult to trace . Caldwell said it was easy to obtain guns in New Mexico : "" we found it was pretty easy to buy guns . All you had to do was show some identification and it was easy to get . "" Caldwell said she and <unk> went to a university library to find the identity "" of someone dying very young "" , next went "" to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate "" and described how "" we got a rent <unk> book and just made up a rent <unk> "" . "" And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in <unk> with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets , "" said Caldwell . They were able to obtain one <unk> <unk> @-@ caliber revolver , and four <unk> <unk> @-@ caliber Security @-@ Six Magnum <unk> . The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a <unk> Lines bus . Caldwell said that she and <unk> traveled by bus back to the <unk> commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors .

 After obtaining guns the conspirators returned to Portland , Oregon . They rented out an apartment in Portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of Turner . <unk> follower Carol Matthews ( Ma <unk> <unk> ) used a fake name during the planning of the assassination plot , in an attempt to obtain the home address of Charles Turner . According to federal prosecutors Matthews obtained a college <unk> of Turner 's , and learned his car 's license plate number and his parking location . Court records state that Matthews and an <unk> co @-@ <unk> gave <unk> registration officials fake identities and told officials they were conducting "" a <unk> survey on President Reagan 's economic plan "" , in order to obtain Turner 's route number and post office box number . The two tried repeating the story with members of the U.S. Postal Service , but the postal officials did not give them Turner 's address . They then drove around Turner 's neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said "" Turner "" . Matthews had pictures of Turner 's residence developed ; these were later obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) during an investigation of the <unk> commune , and verified after being shown to Turner . 
 Members of the group of conspirators watched Turner 's office , home and car , and discussed methods to assassinate him , hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into <unk> . Their plan was to shoot Turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked , in Portland , Oregon , but the conspirators also debated whether to murder Turner in downtown Portland or closer to his home . After spending multiple nights watching Turner 's house , the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work , or in front of his home . Turner had a reserved parking spot in a federal garage underneath Terry <unk> Plaza in Portland , Oregon . In an <unk> given to the FBI , <unk> Alma <unk> described how the <unk> decided on the federal parking garage as the location : "" <unk> <unk> [ Catherine Jane <unk> ] said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off . "" 
 The conspirators practiced different ways of murdering Turner . According to informant statements to law enforcement , one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble , and the others would then approach Turner with their guns . <unk> later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of <unk> <unk> if the plan was successful . According to The <unk> the <unk> were not carried out because Ma Anand <unk> became distracted by political power plays within the <unk> commune and other members of the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group .

 On February 28 , 1985 , Congressman James H. Weaver gave a speech in the United States House of Representatives in which he asserted that the <unk> were involved in the <unk> attack in Oregon . At a series of press conferences in September 1985 , <unk> accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of involvement in this and other crimes , including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan , a Jefferson County district attorney , and asked state and federal authorities to investigate his allegations . The assassination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement as a result of the ensuing investigation into activities at <unk> . Turner was never physically <unk> , and had retired by 1995 . 
 The <unk> was informed in October 1985 by federal law enforcement officials that Leslie L. <unk> , an investigative journalist who had written a 20 @-@ part series on the <unk> movement in Oregon , was on a "" hit list "" which also included Turner and Oregon Attorney General David <unk> . Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Weaver <unk> the case ; the charges were first detailed at an October 1985 bond hearing in North Carolina after <unk> and his followers were arrested at an airport in Charlotte . Weaver said in court that followers of <unk> <unk> <unk> had plotted to assassinate Turner and <unk> . He said these allegations were reasons why releasing <unk> and his followers from jail would be "" a clear and present danger to public officials "" . The guns purchased by the <unk> followers for the assassination plot had reportedly been dumped in a lake at Rancho <unk> ; the lake was searched by U.S. Navy divers . <unk> divers searched the lake for two days but did not find the guns . 
 Joseph Greene , a U.S. immigration agent , testified in court that FBI agents had learned of the assassination plot from a member of the organization who was in a witness protection program . Greene said that members involved in the assassination plot included Ma Anand <unk> , <unk> Yvonne <unk> , and Alma <unk> . The assassination plot was investigated by the FBI and the Oregon State Police . <unk> told law enforcement that Ma Anand <unk> hoped Turner 's death would prevent an Immigration and <unk> Service investigation which she thought could lead to <unk> 's arrest and <unk> from the United States . Weaver stated "" These attempts to assassinate public officials were because they were presenting an immigration case that might result in imprisonment "" of <unk> . "" There were not simply plans , but at least one ( assassination ) attempt , "" said Weaver at the hearing . 
 A grand jury investigation led by Turner brought charges of "" widespread immigration fraud "" against members of <unk> . <unk> crimes were discovered after Ma Anand <unk> had fled the commune in September 1985 . In December 1985 , 21 followers of <unk> were indicted on <unk> charges .

Catherine Jane <unk> and Richard Kevin <unk> were arrested in West Germany , Ann <unk> McCarthy was arrested in South Africa , and Susan <unk> was arrested in England . In September 1990 , Alma <unk> pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder . <unk> , who had served as Ma Anand <unk> 's bodyguard and <unk> , agreed to testify against the other defendants in the murder conspiracy . Under the terms of <unk> 's plea agreement she received a sentence of two years in federal prison . Carol Matthews was arrested in Baden @-@ Baden , Germany in October 1990 on charges of <unk> and conspiracy to murder Turner , where she was held along with three other <unk> . At the time of her arrest , Matthews was found in possession of a false British passport , and had been traveling under the fake name of "" <unk> <unk> "" . <unk> were brought against Ma Anand <unk> and six other co @-@ conspirators by a federal grand jury in November 1990 . 
 In April 1991 , Carol Matthews and Richard Kevin <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) were <unk> from Germany to the United States in order to appear in federal court in Portland , Oregon . Law enforcement officials from the United States <unk> Service traveled to Frankfurt , Germany and took custody of the Matthews and <unk> at Rhine Main Airport . On April 15 , 1991 , Matthews and <unk> appeared in federal court in Oregon , and both pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy to commit murder and carrying out <unk> . On April 25 , 1991 , Richard Kevin <unk> pleaded guilty in federal court to participating in the murder conspiracy plot against Turner , and in exchange he received a sentence of five years in federal prison and the dismissal of other charges against him relating to firearms and <unk> . <unk> agreed to testify against the other members of the murder conspiracy . <unk> wrote on his plea agreement form : "" In 1985 , meetings were held at the Rancho <unk> ... at which time the possible killing of the United States Attorney for Oregon was discussed . I participated in a number of these meetings and agreed with others to work toward that object . "" Prosecutor Timothy J. <unk> III stated that <unk> had been a member of the <unk> commune in Oregon since it began in 1981 , and that the government was able to prove he joined the murder conspiracy at a point in time after May 25 , 1985 . <unk> said that <unk> was a member of a group called the "" Circle of 38 "" , which was the personal security force that guarded <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that he had served as a weapons instructor and policeman at the commune . <unk> told U.S. District Judge Malcom F.

Lacking an organized center and deep convection , the final advisory was issued on <unk> . The storm 's remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly 175 mi ( 280 km ) southwest of Cabo Corrientes , Mexico .

 In Colima and <unk> , residents were warned of heavy rains that could trigger flooding and mudslides . Schools across both states canceled classes for June 21 .

 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24 , 1910 . It states : "" Life in a country town is often tedious and <unk> , and were it not for the little <unk> and <unk> the <unk> are constantly given , existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed . So the time honored get @-@ <unk> of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay . The <unk> thought well of this established feature . They made it a <unk> occasion for themselves as well as their guests . They were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an <unk> of the good things of life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time . "" 
 "" On the night before such an event neither <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> Gale could get those minutes ' solid sleep for thought that they might have overlooked some essential in the guests ' comfort . At the first <unk> of the rooster they would come hopping down to the kitchen to get the <unk> into shape . So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize dish was a splendid <unk> <unk> <unk> - the <unk> were ever looking after the need of the said <unk> . First <unk> Gale would <unk> to the table whereupon it sat in solemn state , and give it a stir ; then <unk> Gale would <unk> over and give it a stir ; finally <unk> Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise . Then arrived the guests . The Minister and the Mrs. Minister , they were , and some neighbors . While she was receiving them the recollection came to <unk> Gale that the beloved <unk> <unk> had not received its <unk> . Off she speeds to a <unk> of whiskey in the kitchen . She <unk> into the <unk> the right proportion of liquor , and goes back to her guests . Then <unk> Gale remembers that the <unk> has not been flavored . He , too , <unk> himself and a moment later is found pouring whiskey into the sacred <unk> . No sooner has he ceased and returned to his guest than <unk> Gale , who has just remembered about the forgotten <unk> , rushes in and makes for the whiskey . She <unk> ' the right proportion ' in , too . ""

Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was <unk> in 1910 productions . The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes <unk> <unk> , <unk> D. Barnes , Frank H.

The film likely had a wide national release , with advertisements in theaters known in Indiana , Kansas , Wisconsin , and Pennsylvania . The film would also be shown in Vancouver , Canada and was met with praise by the audience at the Province Theatre . In 1917 , years after the film 's release , the film was approved without censorship by the Pennsylvania State Board of <unk> of Moving Pictures . 
 The The Moving Picture World reviewer found the subject to be too long , but did not find it to be a fault . The reviewer states , "" A domestic comedy with a different flavor . In fact , with a <unk> <unk> for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook , the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of <unk> , neither one knowing that the others have done likewise . The humor in this piece centers around this <unk> . What happened to the guests who <unk> of it certainly draws upon the imagination . Imagine eight people , not to speak of the cat , getting drunk on the brandy in one <unk> <unk> ! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week . <unk> as well as <unk> were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters . The <unk> <unk> episode was well done , which is the faint praise that we do not like to <unk> out to anyone . "" Walton of The Moving Picture News was not <unk> by the plot and stated , "" To me the last scene had no humor . It was only the necessary ending to the beginning . True humor does not <unk> from <unk> . "" The New York Dramatic Mirror stated , "" This is the old story of too many cooks , and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way . The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation . ... A weak point in the story is the fact that the <unk> is cut into eight small pieces , making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power . Two <unk> would have been as easy to make as one and would have been more convincing . The character parts are all well taken , although the cook would have been better if she had not seized so many opportunities to talk directly at the camera . ""
